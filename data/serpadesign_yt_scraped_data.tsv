I finally began doing a serious remodel of the animal room that I've had planned for two years. Major changes happened in this one and I uncovered a lot of interesting stories with the animals.

I assumed they could be legit, but I was skeptical if they’d grow into water lilies. That’s when I created this experiment and built an entire aquarium around them. I wanted to see if they’d work. As the tank developed, I realized it could also be a nice home for many of the animals I had from other setups, like the Glowlight Danios and Yellow Shrimp. It was fantastic to observe it unfold, and I’m excited to see how it continues to develop.

2		RuMlpv77lVg	Creating Paradise for the World’s Most Hated Toad (Cane Toad Vivarium)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Cane Toads (aka Marine Toads or Bufo Toads) are infamous for the issues they cause. However, in the right hands, they make good pets. Generally, toads tend to be more social, docile, and receptive to people than frogs, but it can take time. I’ve been raising Pistachio for two years while she grew in secret. I didn’t want to share her until building this.

I think it all came together quite well, and it’s exciting to see her in the animal room after all that time. Here, she will be a great ambassador for an often misunderstood animal. I wanted to do it right for her, and I think the new vertical concrete techniques were the perfect solution. 

Here's the African Bullfrog Paludarium that uses a lot of the same concrete techniques to create a large scale naturalistic setup.

I built the enclosure for this six months ago, and I planned to complete it this fall. Sam had different plans, though. I guess that the clamps were no match for his brute strength, and he escaped!

It was disturbing the first time, but even more so this time. I thought I forgot to put them on at first until I saw how the lid was mangled. Needless to say, I didn't bother to film it because I was more concerned to get him back in the tank.

The next day, I got to work completing this new paludarium. I'm really pleased with how it turned out, and I love the new concrete technique. I'll definitely be using it again!

I thoroughly enjoy seeing flowers and plants, but it’s all made better when butterflies, bees, and other pollinating insects are present. Plus, they’re highly beneficial to have around.

I’ve done similar things, but not to this extent. The garden area is quite large, consisting primarily of native cultivars and native plants, many of which I pulled directly from elsewhere on the property. I knew I could stop there and even built a drinking rock fountain using easy DIY techniques.

The treefrog sage was incredible, too.

All of this still doesn’t even come close to telling the whole story, though. The event occurred months ago, and much has happened since—that and more in the continuation of the series

7		Ka60whtBHko	Hundreds of Frogs Invade the Giant Ecosystem Pond	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I knew that this pond would become an ecosystem and I knew it would be used by frogs. As the saying goes, ""Build it and they will come."" This saying could not be more true for our amphibian friends. Frogs are extremely sensitive, detecting minute changes in their environment through smell, which allows them to locate bodies of water from miles away. It’s truly remarkable. I knew that’s what would happen here because I’ve seen it happen many times before, but what I wasn’t expecting was for hundreds of frogs to invade. A pleasant surprise indeed. 

Also, just so we’re all on the same page, toads are a sub-classification of frogs. A toad is simply a frog with specific characteristics (similar to how a tortoise is differentiated from a turtle). Meaning that all toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads. Anyway, I hope you all enjoy the continuation of the Ecosystem Pond series. Much more to come very soon!

Endless rain caused a lot of mud, making it a challenge. Much of the project had to be completed weeks later, and I’m still working on much of that at the time of this upload.

This portion of the series documents what occurred from the original video until early April 2024. A LOT has happened since then that I’ll share in the episodes to follow.

Tomatoes have never really been on my radar, but I’m surprised by how cool it is. I’ve kept many frogs and don’t know of any others quite like this. The best way I could describe it is a mix between an African Bullfrog and a Pac-Man Frog, yet it’s neither. Anyway, I’m excited to add this one to the animal room.

Over the course of five days, I built it by hand using DIY techniques and materials. For example, I made the filter from a trash can. Since then it’s become what can only be described as a thriving ecosystem both inside and out, full of creatures that moved in on their own accord.

I've been patiently awaiting the day that Maxwell would swim into new waters. Although I made the tank for all my fish, it was built largely with him in mind. In fact, my plans were much different when I still had the silver dollars, but after they passed, this project morphed into what it has become. That said, it still has to grow and my long-term vision is not yet fully realized, but I like how it’s progressed. What do you think?

In the end, it was a really cool way to share my knowledge while also doing something fun and interactive with the crowd. Like I said in the video, I wish I’d done the giveaway portion a little differently, but there’s always next time. Either way, I got to meet so many of you and give someone a cool tank - a win in my books!

There was no way I could have them out of the top of the display itself. I had to get creative. That's when I came up with the idea to create what I'm calling a Hydro-Sump. A solution that uses hydroponic or riparian plant growth to filter the aquarium. That way, the system will remain easily maintained because of the benefits provided by these plants.

Well, actually, it was my wife's idea. A few months back, I had to get glass for an aquarium when she said, ""Can you make a display case vivarium like the one from before? I want something cool for the living room.""

I’ve been sitting on this Milsbo Case ever since and haven’t had the time to make it until now. It turned out really well and is probably one of my favorites yet because of how simple it was to produce. I can’t wait to see how this jungle establishes and takes on a life of its own.

He’s been a great addition to the animal room and an awesome turtle in general. Since then, he’s been living in a 40 gallon tank, but that was never the long-term plan. I’ve wanted to move him into a 75 gallon pretty much since the beginning, but it wasn’t available. It recently cleared up, though, so the time is now.

This time, I wanted to closely mimic a loggerhead’s natural environment, and more specifically, something revolving around cypress knees. Combining those with various other elements produced some amazing results, and Walnut truly seems to enjoy it. It’s always awesome to see the animals immediately display behaviors you design around. I can’t wait to see and document how this ecosystem comes to life!

It's something I've wanted to do, but I held off until the time was right. I've been trying to get them since last year, but they haven't been available until early last month. I've been building the colony since and am happy to have finally finished their new home.

I'm so glad to have finally done this and I'm excited to share more in the future. Enjoy!

I still wouldn't consider this to be a beginner build, but I think it could be easily replicated with a little practice and finesse.

26		S4dFawS68BQ	Definitive Guide to Growing Houseplants in an Aquarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"For many years, I've been utilizing tropical houseplants as an essential element within my aquariums, paludariums, and ripariums. Doing so has allowed me to streamline my process and maintain these setups more easily. That’s because of the many benefits that plants provide. They make it possible to spread out maintenance sessions significantly. 

Believe it or not, it’s straightforward to do with the correct information! I’ve experimented with various techniques and plants over the years, many of which I share in this video. I can confidently say that it’s easier to care for setups that have riparian houseplants. Riparian houseplants are also more manageable than their regular potted counterparts.

This guide thoroughly explains why these plants are beneficial, how the work in nature, and how you can incorporate them into your nature designs.

UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I knew I wanted to replace the aquarium in the wall with a paludarium, but I wasn't sure where that journey would take me. That was until I was inspired by some junk / scrap materials I had in my storage area. Many of those are covered in glue, plaint, and foam). Others aren't viable for anything on their own. I figured, why not see what I can do by combing pieces together?

I ended up with something incredible! I also think this is a great example of how you could work on a budget by combining small pieces to create large ones. I've done it in the past, but after this, I'll definitely do it more. What do you think of this paludarium? Let me know in the comments!

It looked great and would actually work long-term, but I knew I could do better after I discovered it was actually a fishing spider.

The woods around my house are part of the temperate forest biome complete with creeks, moss, ferns, trees, etc. Other than taking liberties with materials, this vivarium is a nearly perfect representation of where this spider would live in nature.

I'm ecstatic with how this turned out and I think it's the perfect way to showcase such an incredible animal. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

If I'll be honest, one of those decisions has troubled me throughout the entire year. I’ve been wondering for a while if I made the right call.

I've been actively producing content on SerpaDesign for seven years now, and for five of those, things have been extremely consistent. I've gradually changed things over time, but I worked to improve things significantly this year, which is causing projects and videos to take even longer. Because of that, I decided to upload less frequently. This might not sound like a big deal, but from a content creation cycle, a lack of consistency is not ideal.

This has caused me to reconsider a lot and, ultimately was good for the channel. As stated, I’ve made improvements in the content itself, but in many other ways as well. I’ve addressed organization/workflow issues, set in motion incredible projects that you haven’t seen yet, and much more. I could go on, but I think you get the point. 

All things considered, 2023 was a good year for the channel, but I think 2024 will be the best. Thank you so much for your support and viewership this year. It means more than you could ever know.

When I found the first container, I thought it would be the perfect vessel for a terrarium. That's when my mind went to a cloud forest, which is home to an array of incredible plants, like orchids, ferns, and moss. The kind of stuff that does exceptionally well in a terrarium.

With this build, I set out to capture to essence of a cloud forest within the confines of a container, using some fun and easy techniques. I've made a lot of jungle designs so far, but I think this is one of my best attempts at encapsulating that idea to date. What do you think? Let me know, and enjoy the video!

I've put them in an array of containers over that time to showcase the artistry of terrarium. That bring us to Crocs. I recently got a few pairs and decided that I might as well create little ecosystems to embellish them with. I personally think they look awesome and it was a fun project to make. What do you think? Let me know and enjoy!

38		PAZgE2NNXFc	Easy DIY Habitat for Huge Spider Intruder	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Earlier this week, I found a Fishing Spider that snuck into my home. There's no telling how long it's been living here, but I didn't really want it free roaming... neither did my wife! She found him to begin with. I managed to capture it and decided to design a custom habitat for him since he insisted on living in my home. 

EDIT: Unfortunately, I made an error in this video. What I thought was a Wolf Spider is actually a Fishing Spider, likely Dolomedes tenebrosus. I spent hours trying to get a proper ID as I scripted the video and even got other opinions. I believed it was Hogna aspersa, but I got it wrong. Thankfully, this is still an ideal habitat for this species, but I don’t like that I messed that up. Regardless, I'm still happy to have this spider around and am excited to share more in the future.

For years he's been keeping them in standard bin-style setups for ease of maintenance and care. That said, as we've been working together for the past few years, he's become more interested in display designs. Not only do they look better and allow the animals to exhibit a fuller range of behaviors, but they also make it easier for people to get inspired by the animals (that's what I think at least). 

In this week's video, we make a proper display setup that various species of baby turtles will call home over the coming years. The hatchlings will grow up in it until they either move outside or make their way into other people's hands. Enjoy!

I've shown them a few times over the years, but I haven't done a dedicated project for them till now. I'm honestly not sure why it's taken me this long, but I'm so glad that I finally did.

I've made isopod vivariums before, but this one has me really motivated to do more. Being able to get a proper look at the duckies was awesome and I'd imagine it would be similar to other elusive species as well. I've seen them more in the past few days than I have in the entire time I've been keeping them. I think that's partly because I can observe without disturbing the bin.

We thought that would be the most effective way to house and showcase Shell Dweller Cichlids (Neolamprologus similis). He's been keeping guppies and other tropicals outdoors for years, but he's never had a fish tank quite like this. So it was a lot of fun not only to build, but to see how he's been inspired by it since.

I knew there were ways I could reimagine this idea. This time, I'd include driftwood and plants alongside real luminous quartz crystals. Additionally, I had a spare DIY IKEA Aquarium on hand that was a perfect footprint (https://youtu.be/ir4kHioCSM0).

He's one of the biggest dragons I've seen, but he was in a small enclosure. I knew I had to go big for him, so I painstakingly built him a custom 310 gallon bioactive ecosystem. I will have to spot clean, but otherwise it should mostly maintain itself. 

Something I didn't discuss in the video is that I never got to speak with the family that had him previously. Also, to my knowledge, the employee that brought him to me doesn't know who I am. I'm just in the store often getting food for the animals. I guess she thought I was the right person to ask.

If there's an animal I've shown the most, it's definitely split between him and Samson. Henry (aka The Homie) is a very special animal/gecko to me. Aside from being an absolute character, he jump started my journey of keeping New Caledonia Geckos. I enjoyed him so much that I later ended up with two more, one of which is a Gargoyle Gecko.

I can't get enough of these incredible animals and I'm excited to share this one with you. It's crazy to see how much I've honed my craft and learned over the years. This story does a great job illustrating that. Plus, you can never have enough gecko content... Right?!

However, I've been planning for this specific build since last year and began making in May. There were a few key features I wanted to include in this terrarium table - a waterfall edge, a live edge, a stream, and an actual running waterfall. Deciding how to best construct it, while retaining a beautiful design was difficult, but I couldn't be happier with how it turned out. It's hands down one of my favorite projects I've ever done.

We've had quite the adventure over the years. When I look back on it all in this format, it's very nostalgic as well. He's been around for half of my life and a lot has happened during that time.

He's lived in a variety of arrangements and most recently in a custom built plywood setup. Although I enjoyed it initially, I've slowly become disenfranchised with it. It still served him well, but it could be better. So I decided to finally give his bioactive vivarium a proper redesign.

I didn’t have a clue what he was talking about. He showed me a picture of them and said we should make a planted tank with them.

Initially, I didn't want to because these are ugly decorations, but the more I thought about it, the more I saw the potential. Even though they're unnatural, they're very functional for fish and, when combined with select elements, might actually look pretty cool. So, I curated the materials and we made it happen!

What do you think of our wacky project? Let me know and enjoy the video!

A lot has happened since then and I wanted to circle back on this setup to see how it's doing today. Nano setups in general are more challenging for a number of reasons: plants fill in faster, they're cumbersome to maintain, and conditions are generally more unstable. All of that in mind, how did this setup fare all this time later?

While there, I took a day to make a setup for some of the world's smallest turtles! More specifically, the Three-Striped Mud Turtle. These little turtles are really cool and native to Florida. That in mind, I thought it would be best to recreate an Everglades cypress marsh biome or biotope for them. This outlines exactly how I did that.

That pond was fine, but it was quite small. Especially once they got goldfish. Even then, I knew I wanted to redo the entire thing to go larger.

This time, I took a DIY approach in hopes to create a beautiful pond on a budget. All things considered, I believe I did exactly that. Even so, there are additional ways to save as I explain in the video.

Anyway, join me as begin Pond Season 2023!

It more or less all started with a humble vivarium, then to terrariums, and the rest is history. It's been quite a journey and this recap really only scratches the surface of what happened. Inevitably a lot of material had to be removed to maintain a concise presentation. Thank you for 10 years!

I had it up and running ever since and the guppies have reproduced a lot since then. I wanted to put them in something larger that followed the same principals, but this time in an aquarium. At the end of the day, low tech setups such as this become an ecosystem that more or less sustain themselves.

I wanted to talk about them again and as I went through everything to do a proper update/retrospective, I completely underestimated how much of a role they've played in the growth of my craft.

I also didn't realize I made one of the saddest video on my channel until I got done watching the final edit. It was not my intention at least. No joke, this one got me in the feels. These toads have been with me for a third of my life, in four of the five houses I’ve lived in, and much more. Additionally, seeing the journey of my hobby outlined to this extent is weird to say the least. I have so much appreciation for these toads and the joy they’ve brought me over the years is priceless.

However, as I was building out the animal room a few months ago, I made my decision... In the bathroom! I know it sounds silly, but it actually ended up being a great place for it.

Visually, I think the tank turned out really well and I believe I nailed the in-wall aesthetic. From a functional perspective, though, having an aquarium in the bathroom is definitely the move! It just makes sense. I think so at least. What do you think? Let me know in the comments!

I love this frog, but recently there was an issue with his paludarium. At some point during the move the seal on his tank broke and it began leaking. I never determined precisely what happened, but I had no choice other than to completely redo his setup. As I explain in the video, I would've had to fix it at some point anyway. I just had to do it much sooner than anticipated. 

Anyway, over the years I've had a lot of time to observe Samson and determine precisely what he wants from a home. I thought it would be cool to go through his entire journey thus far to give better context to all of that. This is how I built his new home and his journey thus far. Enjoy!

I also felt that I could do something better, so I decided to redo the setup completely. Enjoy!

From the start, I set out to create the most beautiful and functional space possible to showcase this hobby. I think I pulled that off, but I want to know what you think.

It's been a challenging endeavor to say the least. Despite all of the stress and being burnt out, I still had fun doing it and would everything to get here. That wouldn't have been my response a few weeks ago, but looking back now and seeing mostly everything completed puts it all into perspective.

This has been a lifelong dream come true. I've always wanted a space dedicated to my craft and it's been something I've worked to for years. I never could've imagined it would turn out this good either. It's rare that I'm this content with a project, but I guess given the amount of time spent on it, I certainly should be. 

Anyway, thank you so much for patience and support over the past few months. It's been a rough journey full of many ups and downs. Understand that I can only discuss so much on YouTube and there was way more going on behind the scenes that further complicated the process. I really want to paint the fullest picture I could in this video, though. Enjoy!

71		UUEH_Ewta2U	Underwater Riparium Air Pockets for Houseplants Grown in Aquarium Substrate Aquascape	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I thought of this idea about a month ago while adding concepts to my idea book. I like to do that as inspiration strikes, so I never forget anything. While revisiting a few things, I was reintroduced to this idea. I wasn't quite sure how I make it happen or if it was even possible, but I had a strong feeling that it would be.

Sure enough it was and I'm really excited with the result. I know that terrariums and ripariums are both viable long term solutions and this is essentially just a combination of the two. As such, I have no reason not this think this should work. My only complaint is condensation on the glass. For now I'm fine to leave it like this, but if I decide to keep the aquarium going indefinitely, then I'll try to come up with a solution.

Anyway, enjoy this fun and challenging project and let me know what you think about it down in the comments!

Being organized and knowing where everything is makes it so much easier to maintain a large group of animals. So, including this sort of room seemed like a now brainier. However, I didn't want to dedicate too much space for this.

In this video, I take you through the process of transforming a bland looking closet into a functional and beautiful looking space. I don't know about you, but I think there's something so satisfying about seeing a transformation like this. What do you think about what I've done thus far? Also, what else do you think I should include in this space? Let me know down in the comments!

There were A LOT of significant things that occurred, both good and bad. I traveled and collaborated a few times, built some of my favorite projects to date, and just about completed my dream animal room space. The combination of moving, creating content, and other things had me truly burnt out for the first time.

After all is said and done, it was a hard year, but a good one. As I made this video it really gave me perspective on everything that happened. With that, I just want to say THANK YOU for supporting me throughout this year! None of this would be possible without your help. I can't wait to show you what's next!

74		HK0vWQGwNOE	Dripping Jungle Paludarium for Community of Tiny Frogs (African Dwarf Frog Setup)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I've been getting requests to do a build for African Dwarf Frogs for years now. These adorable little frogs are pretty common and easy to care for. You just have to ensure they're well fed and in a clean, well-decorated enclosure. If given the proper environment, they'll thrive and surely bring a smile to your face. I haven't kept them in many years, but I really enjoyed them when I did.

Like any frog, they'll eat anything they can fit in their mouth. So keep that in mind if you decide to cohabitate with anything else. They're timid and not great at finding food, making them easily out competed. Taking the time to hand feed can eliminate this issue entirely and they'll learn when it's time to do so. Just make some noise and be patient. Once one comes the rest will follow. This will also greatly mitigate the risk of impaction. That said, if you use a fine substrate it shouldn't be an issue because they're pretty good about spitting out non-food items. Definitely worth noting regardless. Go easy on the bloodworms as well. They're not a great staple food and should be provided sparingly. 

Also, as I said in the video I don't think they're for everyone. They take a little bit of extra care, but if you're willing to provide it, they're a very rewarding frog to keep. They're just so tiny, clumsy, and goofy! Plus they do incredible in groups and interact with each other. That said, if you hear a little ""buzzing"" or ""chirping"" sound near the tank, it's probably a male frog calling for a female. If he's feeling good, you'll hear him all the time!

Anyway, I hope you all enjoy the video! Let me know what you think about these little frogs and if you do or have kept them before.

75		J4e7xzevT5E	Indoor Ocean - My Saltwater Coral Reef Marine Aquarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"""Would you consider making a saltwater aquarium?"" This has been one of the most requested videos on the channel since 2016! As I explained, it's something I've wanted to do for awhile. I just wanted to ensure I did it right. That way, I can learn as much as possible with my first tank and translate that all into more accessible/intricate builds in the future.

I've known I would create a reef aquarium for years now, but it was just a matter doing it. I was pretty nervous at first and even now I'm constantly checking up on the tank. However, I'm the type of person that just has to go for it and I think this was the push I needed. Plus it got me to finish the new animal room much faster than anticipated, so that's a bonus.

I knew I would like it all and I'm sure I will even more with time, but I'm enjoying it way more than I expected. I guess that's until something goes wrong, but I'm here for it. It's pretty cool to start something completely new, with minimal prior knowledge. 

Anyway, the won't be the last of saltwater from me. Stay tuned for more and for updates on this tank. Thank you for encouraging me to do this now for the past six years or so.

This entire build was sponsored and provided by Fritz Aquatics. They made a video as well, documenting the process. Check it out!

76		Oe2LZEVMZEc	So I Ended Up With 100 NEW Fish. Now What?	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I'm always happy to take on or adopt animals that need a good home, but I wasn't expecting this. One of my best friends told me his aunt had some baby koi that needed a new home. I've wanted to get some koi, so I figured this was a good opportunity to get them. However, they were not koi and there ended up being WAY more fish that originally described. Either way, I gladly took them all.

I also took the time to address Cookie the snapping turtle's tank. I've needed to do it for awhile and intended to wait until I move it into the new animal room. I couldn't wait much longer, though, so I got to it! It's crazy to see how much she's grown.

I'm always imagining new way for it to be done and in this one, I show you a different way.

Although I've done it before, I personally think this is one of my best ones yet! The water flows pretty vigorously and the piece overall just has an appealing aesthetic to it. I think that's largely due to the use of Pagoda Stone and moss. The combination of the two and running water, just makes for a really beautiful design.

I want to know what you think, tough. Let me know in the comments and enjoy the video!

78		ROjuHgd-6PQ	I Installed an Aquarium in My Bathroom Wall... I'm Excited!	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I've been working on the new animal room since September, which has been a very long and drawn out process to say the least. When I began, I expected to finish everything within a few weeks. Needless to say, I quickly realized it wasn't going to happen that quickly. Just over two months in and things are finally starting to shape up.

What I've shown is really just an abbreviated version of what's been done thus far. There was a lot of planning and time that went into this. As you've seen, I a lot of the work myself, but I've had a few professionals in for other details. Aligning with their schedules added to the complexity of it all as well, but here we are.

Anyway, I was hanging drywall pretty much all week. I was also working on a really cool project, which you'll see next week. I intended to share that this week, but I kept finding myself walking through the animal room, imagining how the space will continue to transform. So even though I wanted to do the project, I kept thinking to myself, ""follow the passion,"" and this is where it led me.

As always, I hope you all enjoyed seeing the progress of things and are as excited as I am about all of this! I have SO MUCH planned for this space that I can't wait to share. Stay tuned for that and enjoy the video!

79		-80duM-USGA	Crazy Moss Ball Terrarium but It's NOT What You Think	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I've been making terrariums for many years now. There are countless things I enjoy about them, like capturing nature, but the thing I really wanted to focus on in this video, is how they're able to encapsulate memories.

As most of you know, I recently moved. The last thing I had to do was clean the pond and collect the fish. As I did that, I really enjoyed the sights of the pond and my yard. I also got sentimental about the time spent there and I got to thinking - I should make a terrarium to capture those memories. However, one thing led to another and I ended up making three of them... I also found some INCREDIBLE elements that made for some truly unique and memorable pieces.

The rest of the video speaks for itself. Let me know what you think in the comments and enjoy!

80		8_tZngg8rMA	Minimalist Mountain Islands Paludarium (Rock Filtered)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I've been considering a minimalist paludarium or aquascape for awhile now. After dismantling a few setups and realizing that the structure from the Fern Rock Planter would be perfect for a build, like this, I got to work. I think this was a great way to reuse previous assets and create some cool. What do you think?

I realize a minimal type design is not everyone's cup of tea, but I thick it's pretty neat and adds variety to the animal room. As I said in the video, there's something about the open/negative space that makes everything else pop, which makes it very interesting to observe... In my opinion at least.

I didn't want to draw the process out this long, but one thing led to another and here we are. The entire process took much longer than expected. There were plenty of hiccups as well, but pretty much all the animals made it there safely, which is the important thing.

I meant to talk about it in the video, but my plan was and still is to rebuild the 350, but in a different way. I'll have to get some replacement glass now since we dropped the back, but that's alright. My plan for it is much different than before and I can't wait to share that.

I can't wait to show you all what's next and I appreciate your patience as I worked through all of this. Enjoy the video!

Unfortunately, it's not possible to move this tank without doing so. It kind of works out, though, because I came up with some new ideas for it that will make it even better than before. I'll go over all of that in a later video.

The rest of the process has been anything but smooth. There were a lot of other issues I had and am still dealing with that I outline in the video. However, I'm almost done and the end is in sight.

83		kGmbgFfiRHA	I Absolutely Hate Doing This. It's So Stressful	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Since I've been making animal rooms (roughly 16 years) there has been a reoccurring challenge... moving! After all is said and done, this will have been the fourth time and hopefully the last. If you've never had to move stuff like this, trust me, it's a terrible experience. Even if everything goes correctly, it's still very stressful.

I don't like uprooting my animals and moving the tanks at all. However, I don't have any choice and the time has finally come to start building my life and SerpaDesign somewhere else. So, in this one, I take you on the start of that journey. We'll move a decent amount of the animals and take a look at some of the buddies.

Enjoy the video and have a great weekend! I can't wait till this is all over and we can move forward. Stay tuned!

84		QhPgAnEku_o	Blackwater Riparium for Blue Tetras in the IKEA Aquarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"A few weeks ago, I made tanks that will be part of the new animal room. All four of them will encapsulate various type of environments, such as this blackwater riparium. I want to consolidate a few of my tanks to make the move easier and many of those fish will do very well in a community aquarium, like this. Plus, they all prefer a blackwater system, so it only made sense to start with this one.

I figured while I was at it, I might as well turn it into a riparium (an aquarium that includes terrestrial/marginal plants above the water). I'm always looking to make things easier and lower maintenance and putting plants above the rim always helps with this. They filter the water very effectively, which can greatly spread out the need for water changes and other maintenance.

Anyway, I'll show more about this in a future video and I can't wait to share what's next. Stay tuned for that and enjoy the video!

85		DGllR4saJbE	Making Easy to Maintain Isopod Bins and Care	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I've been keeping isopods for a few years now, but I haven't showcased them on the channel quite like this. That's partly because I usually just use them as part of the cleanup crew, but also because I was trying to figure out how to maintain a proper Rubber Ducky colony.

I've wanted to make a video like this for years and now was finally the time. Jaden randomly sent me a bunch of isopods (I didn't ask for them, nor did he ask me to make a video about them) which meant I had to make a bunch of new colonies. Since I was doing it anyway, I felt that this could be a great way to illustrate how I successfully keep isopods in current day.

As always, keep in mind that this is what works for me and what I'm keeping. I may have downplayed it slightly, but care for each species is specific, even if it's usually just about how wet their home is. Either way, research and considerations should be made accordingly.

86		ir4kHioCSM0	Making The Best and Easiest DIY Aquariums From IKEA?	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I've been repairing and building aquariums for many years now. Typically that involves cutting glass, so it's not necessarily the most accessible task around. That said, I've been trying to find a way to build custom rimless tanks, that don't involve cutting glass. I want DIY aquariums to be an option for everyone.

It took me awhile to discover a solution, but not long ago, I had a eureka while at IKEA. I realized that they sell a lot of good glass shelving that could be used to build aquariums. So, I got to work finding pieces that could fit together, and to my surprise, they had several sets that work!

In this video, I outline the entire process from start to end. I decided to cover every aspect of it because I've never explained the tank construction process in much detail. Sure, I've shown it a ton of time by now, but there are a lot of tricks that I generally leave out to make the video more concise. Anyway, you could use these techniques to build most glass tanks.
All three tank sizes require the items listed below in the material list. The shelves specific to make each size tank are listed separately. I discovered two additional sizes that weren't included in the video and included them below.

87		gL7gtHOS4u8	Exposing My Big Secret That Changes It All (The Truth)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"For a few weeks now, I've been hinting at some big that was about to happen. That said, it's taken a lot longer than I expected to tell you about it. I've been working extremely hard to make this all a possibility, but even so, a lot of things have stood and continue to stand in my way. I know these are just growing pains of the situation, though. 

The current animal room hasn't served me pretty much the entire time I've had it. Regardless, I've made it work. I'd say the primary issues are the layout, lack of storage space, and the garage workshop. All of these combined together make for a situation that complicates everything about what I do. You'd think the primary issue would be the size of the room itself. However, I'd say the whole thing is made way smaller because of those other details.

Anyway, moving into a completely new and bigger space will change everything. I can actually design it around every aspect of what I do to truly optimize the entire process. From water changes, to building, to filming, I'm accounting for everything. I'll outline all of that in future videos.

That's all I have for now, though... I have to get back to work! Enjoy the video and let me know what you want to see in the new room.

This one was a little different, though, because we had to create it from a few stock ponds. Our other friend, Charlie, texted and explained that we wanted to build a cool breeding setup for two albino snapping turtles using these ponds, we had full creative freedom otherwise.

We put our heads together and with a little bit of planning, a lot of work, and fun, I think we came up with something that looks incredible! You would never know this is a stock pond setup, unless we told you! Anyway, the rest of the video speaks for itself, so enjoy the build and let me know what you think in the comments. 

ALSO, the pond is much bigger than it look. We were able to retain the majority of the space within the basin. It just doesn't appear that way from the top with all the branches and plants, but that was a purposeful decision. We wanted to ensure that the turtles had somewhere cool they can go during the heat of the Florida Sun.

It was a real challenge to pull off and something that I'm truly proud of, even to this day. Sure it might not be the best looking thing around,  but that's alright. It still does everything it's designed to do and it's been so enjoyable to have. However, the time for it had come and the sad truth of this pond, which I've known for awhile now, must be revealed. More on what's happening in the future... stay tuned.

I tried to keep it as simple as possible and I think it was really easy to build. Other than the expertise involved with stacking the rocks, the rest requires little to no finesse at all. I left a complete list of materials below if you'd like to make one for yourself.  Enjoy!

This wasn't the first time I recovered a tank in this manner, but it was the first time I found a vintage tank like this. I was very excited, but years later and I still haven't done anything with it. That is, until now.

Unfortunately, I couldn't just go and create a new aquascape in the tank. The entire thing needed cleaned, dismantled, and reassembled with some new materials. After all, the thing is 60 years old! A lot went into all of that, but I'll let the video tell the rest of the story.

In fact, some of you were wondering if something like this can even work.

I've decided to turn this one into an update and I think you'll be pleased with the results. Let me know what you think about the progress of it thus far. Also, I should mention that part of why it look different now is because it's against a white background, which lightens things up. Anyway, enjoy the video!

As I explored the concept, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. That was easier said than done, though. One thing led to another and I ended up using a lot of different techniques to create what I had imagined. I had a lot of setback and it took me awhile to pull it off, but it's finally complete!

I'm so excited to share this one with you all and I really hope you all enjoy the build. Let me know what you think about it down in the comments, like, and subscribe for more!

Note: I mentioned in the video that I would have changed a few things if I had more time. Originally I wanted the hands to create a second waterfall, but I had to raise the water above what I originally planned to maximize water volume. Additionally, I would have made the hardscape with smaller, more intricate details, to give a different sense of scale. I think it would look cool if the sculpture appear larger than it does in the current design. Regardless, I'm pleased with the result.

I've been thinking about what I could do with them that unique and showcases the plant, especially since I haven't really shown them on the channel yet. I felt that really embracing the bamboo vibe was the way to go.

Luckily, I had a lot of other materials on hand, including bamboo, that allowed me to make a mini shishi-odoshi fountain. I couldn't be happier with how it turned out! I think it's a really neat an unique piece. What do you think? Let me know in the comment!

My idea with this project was to create a tabletop waterfall planter that features a serene landscape. In my opinion, the result is pretty nice and has a unique look about it. What do you think? My favorite feature is the pooling area near the bottom of the falls.

I'll let the video do the rest of the talking, though. Let me know what you think about it down in the comments and I'll see you next time!

102		SuCzGqCJ3jI	Did My Terrarium Computer Desk Survive? (2 Years Later)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"In this one, we take the updated two year look at THE terrarium computer desk! This is one of my favorite pieces in the animal room (as of now) that is a huge part of what I do because I work at it daily.

Initially, I built this out of reclaimed material, designed it in a way that would be functional for me, and made the video. I put it out there and I figured a lot of you would like it. See original build video here https://youtu.be/UrrQodJExb0

It was received well by the vast majority, but there was certainly a good bit of you who perceived that some of my choices were serious errors. I'm happy to admit when I'm wrong, but I would consider nearly all of these to be non-issues. So, I had a little bit of fun in the previous update. It's definitely worth watching if you missed it https://youtu.be/usXRjOCKhqA

Anyway, I continued with that tune in this video and had some fun with it. I hope that you enjoy what I did here. Let me know what you think about the progress of this desk and what would you like to see in terrarium desk 2.0!

I thought to myself, ""what would a crystal cave aquarium look like."" One thing led to another and I ended up with what I think is a really cool design. In fact, this is probably one of my favorite setups I've ever done!

As I said in the video, there's something extremely captivating about the ethereal, otherworldly vibe of this enclosure. I want to know what you think, though! Let me know your thoughts down in the comments and like the video if you enjoyed it!

104		POamgZ8Ex3w	Crazy Bonsai Waterfall Rock Mountain Terrarium (Cloche Penjing Landscape)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"A few weeks ago I was really inspired by the bonsai trees at Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens (see this video for more https://youtu.be/p4TVT51af9o). They had a great display and I've been thinking about them ever since. In fact, I've had these trees since the day after I got home. I immediately went out to get some for this build.

Although I'm very intrigued by bonsai, penjing is probably more up my alley. Penjing, for those of you who don't know, focuses on creating a mini landscape which conveys emotions, as apposed bonsai which focuses solely on the tree. In fact, penjing came before bonsai. Both are incredible forms of art, but I like the idea of creating scenes or landscapes.

In some ways, you could argue that I've been making penjing on the channel already, but this is the first piece that I've made with that in mind. Being that I just saw the trees and was inspired by the beautiful landscapes of Florida, it only makes sense that this is the route I went.

I really enjoy the final design and can't to see how the trees grow over time. What do you think, though? Let me know in the comments!

105		FaNtLHy5wVo	Huge Ecobulb Riparium Jungle for Rare Fish on DIY Branch Stand	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"About two months ago, I obtained a really incredible container - the giant jug that I use in this video to be specific. I wasn't quite sure what I would do with it, though, so I left in the garage to collect dust. Eventually, I had a general idea of what I wanted to create and I got to it.

Since it's fairly tall, I thought that a riparium or paludarium would be a cool option. However, I didn't have a dedicated spot for it. So I began by making a stand out of tree branches. It seemed like a cool direction to go since the container itself is so unique. With that, I also felt that it made sense to include some rare fish. What better than the Orange Medaka Ricefish?

Anyway, this is how I turned an incredible container into a lush, live planted riparium setup that's really unique. Let me know what you think of this build and enjoy the video!

Naturally I filmed a greater portion of my trip, which largely consisted of seeing friends and exploring. So, technically I did work, but it's not quite the same as the norm.

Anyway, it was nice to get a recharge. Not that I wasn't motivated before, but now I'm even more so now and thought of a ton of awesome project during my time away.

Also, as I said in the video, I'm currently looking for a captive-bred pair of Red Head Agama lizards. I've been searching for a few months now, but haven't had much luck. If any of you have a lead please let me know! I'll be making their enclosure soon, so I'm almost ready to go.

Unfortunately, when you do this sort of work, things go wrong. That's why it's really important to keep an eye on everything to ensure issues can be addressed and resolved quickly. Luckily, I was able to get everything taken care of without any major problems.

On top of this I had other stuff going on, like running out of space in the animal room. In this one, I show you how I take care of that with a new rack. 

Anyway,  I hope you enjoy the video regardless. Has anything like this happened to you recently? Also, what do you want to see on the new rack.  Let me know and have a great weekend SerpaSquad!

He's been living in the quarantine area ever since. I've planned to make a proper blackwater setup for him ever since. I had to do a lot before that that I'll discuss in a future video.

As I set this up, I wanted to make something functional to showcase the betta and provide him with an enriching home. At 14 gallons (10 full of water), this is also an excellent footprint for him to swim through. Thanks to the ""H"" shaped log I sourced locally, I also think it looks pretty unique. I've wanted to use it for years now and to have finally done so makes me happy!

Anyway, let me know what you think of the new Samurai Betta and the blackwater aquascape in the comment. Enjoy!

Each time the result is completely different and I can't get enough. As you know, I have a lot of fun building terrariums. So, when I can combine them with other things I do, it brings everything full circle. 

With each build I learn and get closer to the perfect waterfall design. I still haven't got there, but I feel that this brought be closer. I'll continue refining the process until I've found the perfect solution. I have a lot of fun with this concept, but nothing beats a standard  jungle-style terrarium.

This is not something I intended for at all, but the opportunity presented itself and I took it.

Last month we toured the Moorecroft Conservation Foundation (https://youtu.be/EMknY9jQLnw?t=928) and saw a tone of incredible turtles. While there, I talked about how I would be getting some of the turtles we saw. I'm still doing that, but something else happened.

As Charley showed up around, we saw a group of snapping turtles. These weren't your ordinary snappers, though. He explained that they were Common Snapper and Alligator Snapper Hybrids, which came from the late Fred Grunwald. It wasn't thought that they could interbreed, but one day, Fred's turtles did exactly that. Apparently there's likely less than 50 in the entire world!

I didn't intent on getting one of these turtles, but Charley said that they needed homes. I know that I'm in a unique position where I can provide for this animal into adulthood, so I decided to take the opportunity. In this video, I show you how I designed a grow-out paludarium for it. Enjoy and let me know what you think in the comments!

That's a cool project, which was inspired by the container it was built in. The same can be said for this project. I took one look at a pencil organizer and all I could see was a paludarium...

Crazy Adventure to Find the Perfect Turtle	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I spent the other week down in Florida, where I saw a lot of incredible things! I visited a few friends, explored the pine glades, went to Aquashella, and got to see my turtles in person!

Many of you have been requesting turtle content for a while now and I'm finally about to make that happen. I have huge plans for various species that I know you'll love. More on that in the future - stay tuned!

In the meantime, I really hope you enjoy coming along on this adventure with me. It was a lot of work to film and edit! So if you enjoyed the video, give me a like and comment to support the channel. Enjoy!

Give some love to folks who I was able to visit and showcase in this video!

Like most of you, I don't ever intend on keeping these animals myself, but I like to showcase other aspects of the hobby. So, when the opportunity arose, I knew I had to make it happen!

The Variable Bush Viper is a great candidate for a bioactive vivarium because of its placid demeanor and relatively small size. They'll spend most of their time in the canopy, but aren't shy about exploring the forest floor. Like many other medium-sized animals, spot cleaning is necessary for optimal results.

Let me know what you think about the completed build down in the comments!

I also wanted to make some tweaks to the 600 gallon vivarium. Longterm I want it to be a fairly hitech setup. The next step into that was to add an automatic mister. I think it was a great inclusion that should make things easier to care for. That said, I'll likely add more spray nozzles. 

Slowly but surely it's shaping up to be a pretty awesome setup. What do you think? Let me know in the comments!

116		1weSZQGGs2k	Micro Crab Riparium Root Bowl (No Filter Low Tech)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"In this week’s video, I show you how I made a no filter low tech bowl for a group of Thai Micro Crabs. My goal was to keep it really simple with easy techniques and minimal materials. I think the result is a pretty neat little setup that showcases these incredible little critters. What do you think?

Going the low-tech route is pretty easy if you design things with that in mind. Utilizing riparian plant growth (above the water) is a great solution. As I’ve explained, these plants are extremely effective at filtering the water. They act like a sponge and pull all sorts of harmful compounds from the system. This helps make conditions more favorable.

Another benefit to using such plants is the number of roots that will grow in the water column. This can serve as a refuge for fish fry or in this instance, a climbing and grazing area for Thai Micro Crabs. They’ll happily climb all over the roots. In fact, this is the type of environment they prefer. So not only will the plants filter the orb, but they’ll also create a great habitat for the crabs.

Thai Micro Crabs (Limnopilos naiyanetri) are a true aquatic nano species. They stay extremely small and unlike many other “aquatic crabs” these will not leave the water. They scavenge or filter for food as they climb on the roots and other surfaces. Because they are so small, care should be taken when moving them into an aquarium.

117		RJPZ_dfQz9c	Isopod Tree Root Forest Vivarium with Easy Clay Background	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"We've made so many different projects over the years and many of those builds included isopods. Till now, you've mostly seen them in vivariums and terrariums, which were a lot of fun. Even still, I haven't made a dedicated setup for them yet. Why? I honestly don't really know. Now seemed like the perfect time though.

I wanted to do things differently for this build. The enclosure itself is pretty standard, other than the sliding doors. I typically wouldn't use them on such a small enclosure. It worked for this because the tank is long.

I also wanted to showcase how to make a clay background. Although I've made them in the past and mentioned them in previous videos, I've never properly showcased them before. That said, I did briefly mention them in the Wabi Kusa tutorial. https://youtu.be/m-Oqdyr7l0Y

The combination of various elements made for a unique-looking setup that showcases the isopods well. As I said in the video, I wanted to loosely replicate the look of a fallen tree. Specifically the uprooted area. I didn't have much to work with at the time, but regardless, I think I pulled off that look quite well. What do you think? Let me know in the comments!

It uses a few of the concepts from the upflow overflow aquascape (https://youtu.be/N3uNPHmKkjc), but with its own sort of twist and flavor. What do you think of the result?

As you well know, I really like the idea of using riparian (emersed) plant growth to filter my tanks. They're very effective at doing so and they look great in the process. In this instance, I decided to create an upflow filter system with a few glass orbs and other materials I had around the house.

I've also seen a few comments recently that wanted me to outline the deconstruction and build process of making tanks in more detail. I took the opportunity to share that since I was doing it already. Like I said though, it's easier to buy a pre-made enclosure or get pre-cut glass from a local glazier. Do so at your own discretion and be sure to wear gloves and safety goggles.

And while they're by no means difficult to care for, they can be somewhat temperamental. It turns out or at least from what I've seen, that ferns thrive in an elaborate setup with flowing water.

Upfront it probably seems like a lot of work, but it pays off long-term. This is a very low-maintenance type of design that requires very minimal upkeep. You just need to top off the water and occasionally trim the plants.

Anyway, I think this is a really cool build. What do you think? Let me know down in the comments.

I've had big plans for both the 75 gallon and 150 gallon tanks cube for months, but I had to marinate on my ideas. Both visions have changed a lot over that time, so I'm glad that I've waited this long.

Although I love having duckweed in some of my tanks, it's become a nuisance while feeding. To help out with this, I decided to make a few fish portals. They were super easy to make and look pretty cool. I'd highly recommend making some if you incorporate floating plants.

Wabi-Kusa is a type of nature design that was developed by the late Takashi Amano. The term “wabi-kusa” is derived from the Japanese term “wabi-sabi”, which is a philosophy centered around the ephemeral, imperfect beauty of life. 

I felt that this would be a really cool and fun project to showcase on the channel and I'm glad that I did. I think it's a really great starting point to step into nature design. It's also a fun option for someone who's already keeping aquarium plants and wants to try something new.

125		Rdtk54dzU2k	Nano Ginseng Bonsai Tree Island Paludarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"While going through my idea book, I came across what I imagined to be a bonsai tree paludarium. I had a loose idea of what I wanted, but as I imagined things, I couldn't get the idea of an island out of my head. Not just any island though. I wanted to create something that resembles a sea stack. Of course, I took some liberties, but I think the end result speaks for itself.

126		A23ciyDyn3k	thank you.	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Well, it finally happened, on November 15th to be specific. The SerpaDesign YouTube channel reached and surpassed 1,000,000 Subscribers... WOW!

It's been almost a month since then, but I wanted to do something special for the occasion. I couldn't think of any better way to celebrate than with a custom-made vivarium. Not for me though, this one could be yours!

However, it's not really possible to ship it internationally. To keep things fair though, I decided to have two prices. Anyone outside of the contiguous USA will instead have the opportunity to win $475 USD. 

To win, you need to SUBSCRIBE (if you haven't yet), LIKE this video, and COMMENT where you're from.

Potential Prizes
USA Audience (contiguous states only) - Can Win the Vivarium and Extras*
International Audience (+ Hawaii and Alaska) - Can Win $475 USD*

*The winners will be randomly chosen through a comment picker on December 23rd. I will screen capture and record myself doing that for the following video. Winners will be announced on the December 25th upload.

Things have very much been a work-in-progress lately, so I wanted to give it some time before I did another one. Pretty much everything has been improved upon in that time, so I'm really excited to finally bring you this extended look at what I do.

I'm well on my way to building out the 150 Cube at this point, but I need your input on the empty 75 Gallon Tank. Let me know what you want to see in that tank! I'm also building out several other things that I can't wait to share with you. Stay tuned for more!

Also, for anyone new, I have complete and detailed tutorial videos for EVERYTHING I showed in this video. So, if you want additional information on how I made any of these things, then check out my library of videos.

Initially, I kept them in a quarantine thank, but after a few months, I got them set up in a 75 gallon aquarium. They did really well in there, but I noticed something... 

Every now and again I would catch the toads in amplexus. This means they have the likelihood of breeding at some point. I'm not sure if it will happen or not, but if it does, they would benefit from a taller tank. So, I decided to make a new one.

I must have accidentally left the door open a crack when I was feeding her and didn't realize it until it was too late. When I came back 10 minutes later, she was gone!

I searched high and low until eventually, I gave up the search. There are A LOT of places a spider could hide, so it's essentially a losing game. I know this video makes light of a bad situation. It's a mistake I don't intend to make again.

I've had these fish for at least five months. They were really small and I wasn't quite sure what type of tank I wanted to make for them, so I took my time. 

As I thought through things, I thought that a minimal design, like this one, would be pretty cool. After all, was said and done, it appears that the fish really like it as well.

I saw water on the floor while I was misting and thought that maybe I accidentally sprayed some on the floor. Upon closer inspection, I realized that the tank was actually leaking along the back seam!

I was pretty distraught about it because it could've meant the end of this tank. To address the problem, I had to dismantle a large portion of it and rebuild. This documents the entire process.

What would it look like if you made one from natural materials? In theory, it should look much better. I wanted to find out for myself though, so I made one completely from scratch. It took A LOT of work, but it was well worth it.

It's served me well, but I wanted something a little more official. Not quite on the same level as my main room, but something that's sleek and functional.

For the past five weeks or so I have been doing exactly that. Transforming my old qt area into something a little nicer. In this video, I take you on the journey to how I got to that point. There's still a lot of work to do, but the saga has just begun. Stay tuned for more on this and the main room!

I wanted to keep it simple, easy, and beautiful design to showcase the spider. Other than the substrate and plants, I've included links to all of the materials used to make the enclosure (non-affiliate links) for your convenience.

I also had other things to work on. Nothing beats a standard jungle-style terrarium, but I think this is a really cool concept that's awesome to watch. That said, you really need to see it in person to appreciate the view. The waterfalls are fairly substantial, but the video can only translate it so well.

A few weeks back though, the betta it was built for (Ellie) decided to jump out. After that, we no longer wanted to keep the tank around. So, I moved the other inhabitants into their own tank.

I knew we'd get my wife another betta, but I didn't intend for it to be this soon. One thing led to another and I found a fish that I knew she'd love. Here's how I made a paludarium for her new fish.

As I started working through it, I really embraced the rustic artisan vibe. Overall I'm really pleased with how it turned out. From the handmade tools to the terrarium and even the stain choice, I think it shaped up to be a really unique piece. What do you think? Let me know in the comments!

I knew I had to do something that showcases a different side of the aquarium hobby. What do you think?

Also, the fish have made it safely back to my place and are currently going through quarantine. I get them into their respective tanks as soon as possible.

That's exactly what happened with this tank. I found two pieces of wood I knew would be perfect for a blackwater aquascape and everything else followed. Enjoy!

It's being constantly watered, which hydrates the geotextile fabric. That creates a great growing surface for the moss to grow on and thus you have the living moss globe.  Not only that, but once the water reaches the bottom of the globe, the water returns to the basin via laminar flow.

It's been set up for many years now and although it brought me a lot of joy, it's declined in recent times. Unfortunately, my original vision for it just wasn't looking like a possibility, so I felt it best to start over... sort of.

The 180 still lives on in its successor, the new 600 gallon vivarium. As I explained in this one, I took all of the components I could from that setup and integrated them into the new one. It was hands down the best time to do this, so I seized the opportunity.

As for the old enclosure, I have plans. I'll modify it and set it up to be something completely new - you'll LOVE my new idea. Also, dart frogs are still happening, just not in this tank. Stay tuned!

I saw these incredible fish at a local fish store a few weeks back and had to get them for one of my 40 gallon tanks. The specimens I have still need to color up, but they're really beautiful fish with interesting behaviors.

As I said in the video, I'm really looking to add another layer to what I'm doing in the animal room. I'm always trying to showcase incredible animals in nature-inspired setups, but why not do this for threatened/endangered animals when I can? It seems like a great way to bring light to animals such as these.

It's been in the works for a really long time now and I'm so excited to finally have it done! I've been working on it for the past year or so, but I've been talking about it for much longer than that.

In some cases I wanted to keep this build simple. Plus my vision for it always was just a jungle scape full of plants. I didn't care to add a water feature or anything like that. I also WILL stock it at some point. After all the work I put into this, I'd rather have it season for a little while fist. I'm fairly certain I know what I want living in here, but I'm open to suggestions - let me know what you think in the comments!

Also, if you want to know how I built the enclosure itself, check out the below video. It was pretty easy to do to and not very expensive. I used a lot of scrape materials and simple techniques to make it happen.

I've shown you various types since then, but I haven't built a DIY ecosystem pond. I wanted to for a while, so I made it happen and built one for my parents.

They've wanted one for years and I was so excited to make that happen. This one actually was fairly easy to build and I got it done in about 2 days. It took another 3 to add all the final details. I think it turned out great! What do you think? Let me know in the comments!

Also a huge thanks to my friends from AquaScape for supplying the 6x8 Pond Kit. It made the whole process a lot easier because all I had to get were the rocks and plants.

From turtles to monitor lizards, and even a cichlid swim pond, this place has it all. Most of these animals are very personable and want to interact with you as well... or maybe they just want food lol!

Either way, I wanted you all to see this through my lens. It was such an amazing experience that got me really excited about animals I don't currently keep, like turtles. That's something we definitely have to integrate into the animal room ASAP! I forgot just how personable and cool they really are.

Until then, enjoy the tour and let me know what animal you liked best!

He thought it made sense to do a build for his young Black Throated Monitor Lizard. We didn't have much time though. I only had a few days to make the background at home and have them shipped. See what we came up within just a few days time!

162		UKMmcUes7HU	Easy DIY Plywood Reptile Enclosures	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I've been working on these custom, DIY plywood vivariums for about 8 months and now, they're finally done! It took longer than expected because I wanted to show all three sizes in a single video. They all utilize the same design, so it made sense. With slight adjustments, you can scale this up or down depending on what you want to achieve. Enjoy the video and let me know if you have any questions.

Also, I tip for getting your door to slide easier - try using some silicone lubricant. I ended up doing that with the 600 and it really helped. I just applied a few drops to the bottom track under the glass. It also works as a great lubricant for noisy aquarium impellers.

It's a beautiful sight, with a very particular look to it. I figured it made sense to start on a small scale and with moss... I mean, how can you go wrong with that? I don't think so. I hope to do it again at some point on a larger scale. 

Until then, I hope you enjoyed the video. Let me know what you think in the comments!

It can be challenging to do a setup like this for an animal of this size, but I think I came up with a good solution. He's been in it for a few days now and it seems like everything is holding up very well. Hopefully, it stays that way!

I'm so excited to finally have him in a setup like this. I've been wanted to for years, but I knew it would only work in a large enclosure. That's why I did this setup in a custom-built 72x24x28"" (210 gallon) enclosure.

In fact, it's part of the process. Even when our animals live full and complete lives, they still pass on. For me, that's the hardest part.

My goal has and always will be to provide the best care I possibly can. With that, I doubt what happened was an issue on my end, but I blame myself regardless. I'll keep my eyes peeled though because, with any luck, their legacy still lives on through their offspring. I haven't seen anything yet, but I'm optimistic.

If you have any thoughts on what you think happened, let me know in the comments. Also, to be respectful of the animals, I felt it best not to show them on screen. Regardless, I hope you enjoyed the video and liked everything else I had to share.

The series is by far up there as one of my favorites. I can't help but feel so nostalgic about it. The best way I heard it put is that we grew up together with Pokémon.

I remember playing the games everywhere I went as a kid... and that's not an understatement! Did you see how rough my Gameboy looked? LOL! I also remember when I opened a base set booster pack on my 6th birthday in 1999. I pulled one of the big three and my favorite at that, Blastoise! 

The series is absolutely huge right now, today is Pokemon Day, and I wanted to be a part of the fun! I put so much work into this video and I really hope that you all enjoyed it. Let me know if you want to see more themed projects in the future. Peace!

I never made any specifications, but I eluded to the fact that I was going house all of the geckos in a single location. It's been a slow process, but it's finally come to fruition. 

Crested Geckos and Gargoyle Geckos are awesome animals that do great in live planted bioactive vivariums. If you choose a good selection of plants and provide enough space, they're very easy to keep. I didn't want to be too redundant, so I did all three of these in a single video. I have no intentions of bringing in any more New Caledonia geckos and my plan is to keep them in these vivariums for good.

For the sake of this video, I'll call it a runoff environment. It's often seen on hillsides or near creeks that overflow from time to time. I've always thought they were neat and I think it's time to bring that inspiration inside.

Let me know what you think would look awesome living in this setup. I picture some kind of invertebrate, but I don't know what specifically. Maybe a centipede perhaps?

I'll give you an in-depth look at how I scape my tanks. I also set up a few for demonstration. I wanted to show the ENTIRE process, so it's a long one! 

I really hope that many of you get some good takeaways. If I were to scape a tank for real, I would do exactly what you see in this video. Keep practicing, experiment, and always remember to stop scaping and listen! I'm telling you, it helps me a lot and I know it can help you too. 

Originally I planned to put this on my second channel, but as I worked through the video, I thought it could be more appropriate for this channel. It's also my longest video yet! Can't get enough? Then is probably the video for you. Enjoy!

171		FDRTEe-EbIY	This Tank Is Completely RUINED! (It's Bad)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I set up the Suriname Toad aquascape back in November. I was really excited to get the tank stocked, but the setup had different plans... The Dragon Root I used for the hardscape ruined everything! 

It began with the normal molding/film process. I thought nothing of it until things started to stink! It wasn't more than a week before the room smelled strongly of rotten eggs. I didn't know what it was at first, but I soon discovered that it was this tank.

I did what most of us would do and changed the water. That solved the issue, but only for a day. From that point forward, I was stuck doing a daily water change of 100% or the room would smell. I kept it up for a month and resorted to chemicals. The combination of these did help, but it wasn't enough.

Fast forward almost 3 months and things aren't much better. The tank still stinks, the film has not dissipated (even though I remove it), the plants are gone, and I'm tired of dealing with it. I knew the wood was the source of the problem, so I decided to redo the tank entirely.

I'm very surprised by how much fun I've had watching this setup. You'd think a few scuds and snails would be boring, but there's always something going on. I also think the rustic botanical scape is a perfect way to showcase these animals. It's certainly resembles areas where you'd find them in nature.

You've seen me make vivariums before, but this one is a little different. I decided to make a realistic background using Drylok Masonry Paint. 

I know that some hobbyists use it to seal plywood enclosures, but I never would've thought to use it on a background. I found it very easy to use and will definitely mix it in with some of the other techniques I've show before. Let me know what you think of the finished piece. I personally really like how it turned out. 

Although I've never seen him use it like this, I originally got the idea to use this paint from Troy Goldberg. He uses it to make backgrounds for poison dart frogs on his channel. Check it out!

177		TrnoaXj79v4	Ghost Mantis Vivarium pt 1 (Custom Insect Terrarium)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I think it's time to switch it up and add some insects to the animal room! Till now, their presence has been virtually nonexistent in my collection. I've always been intrigued by praying mantises and figured that's where I should start. Since this is my first one, I went with a small and easy to care for species, the Ghost Mantis (Phyllocrania paradoxa).

This animal is incredible! It looks like a leaf and even bobs around to mimic their movements. I have a clip of that at the end of the video. They don't get very large and unfortunately don't live very long either (8 months max). This one is already fairly large, so it likely only has 1-2 months left. That's alright though. I'm just getting my feet wet and this is a great starting point. 

Stay tuned for part 2 of this build. In that one, I'll make the background, plant the setup, and add the mantis. If you want to know anything else about the enclosure or the mantis, let me know in the comments and I'll try to address it in next week's video. Until then, enjoy!

178		C-PWOYSvjlc	Altum Angelfish Biotope Inspired Aquarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"A few years ago my friend Weston had the opportunity to explore the Amazon River and tributaries in Columbia. While there, he saw Cardinal Tetras and other ""aquarium fish"" in their natural environment. After this experience, he dreamed to one day replicate the things he had seen, in the form of a biotope inspired aquarium.

However, he didn't know where to start, so it never came to fruition until we met. He helped build one of my ponds last summer and since then, we've been planning this build. I installed the tank in July and returned earlier this week. This video takes you on the journey of this tank came to be. Enjoy!

I personally think it turned out really well. I enjoy all of the texture and interest created by the slate stones. It's pretty time consuming to stack them up like this, but it's worth the effort. All of that is also complemented by the other elements.  

As with most things I show, these techniques can easily be translated into a paludarium or vivarium setup as well. Your imagination is the limit! Let me know what you think about the finished project and what you'd like to see next in the realm of fountains.

These are incredible animals that needed an equally nice setup. I went with a hardscape focused design, but I also included my new moss wall technique. It's a great way to get a moss-covered background with minimal effort. 

I wish I could have added the toads to the tank, but it wasn't possible for the reasons mentioned in the video and with my filming schedule. I'd rather not rush it just for the sake of a few clips. That said, I'll get them added very soon and film the whole process. Stay tuned!

This time I had the tank propped up on a few boards and bumped it off. The bulkheads were installed, so when it landed the glass cracked. 

No problem, some of my favorite projects to date happened because of mistakes and I think this is one of them. I wanted to create something simple, unique, and different from others I've shown.

I really like how it turned out and it seems like all the inhabitants do as well. What else would you add to the tank? I was thinking Hillstream Loaches, but usually, they're recommended for 30 gallons or more. I know this is only 19, but the footprint of the tank is much larger than usual. Let me know what you think in the comments!

After some consideration and a lot of research, I decided that I wanted to get a pair of Suriname Toads! When I finally saw them in person, I couldn't believe how bizarre and cool they are. I really hope I'm able to get them to thrive and do well for me. 

Also, as I said in the video, they were sold to me as captive-bred animals. I'm not sure I believe that's true though because of how large they are. I really try not to support when possible, so I'd rather not disclose where I bought them.  

Besides that, I've been gathering up materials for their new home and can't wait to get started. I know you're going to love it!

184		Bv7yPldAxpQ	Mini Self-Watering Moss Wall	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Keeping moss indoors can be challenging because in most cases, it requires constant hydration. Terrariums are an easy solution because they retain humidity, which moss will appreciate. What if you want something open? Maybe a moss wall that waters itself? 

Well, you're in luck! After reviewing the feedback from last week's video, it would appear that many of you wanted to see an easier and more accessible living wall. One that features moss, waters itself, and is cheap. Believe it or not, this is a really straight forward build. Plus it looks like something that came pre-made! All you have to do is put it together.

As promised, I left links to everything I used to make this project. I tried my best to find all of the cheapest options, but there may be something I missed. Be sure to look around for yourself just to be sure.

In this one, I tackle a project that I've been wanting to make for a while now... a living plant wall! I tried to keep it as budget-friendly and cheap as I possibly could while making sure it's a quality piece of art. Do a quick google search and you'll see what I mean. This is a really good price for something like this. Pre-build pieces, with live plants, are typically VERY expensive.

Most of the plants and materials I used were found at big box home improvement stores. If you look around online or wait for things to go on sale, you can easily make something similar for much less. Be sure to check around your house and see what you already have. Let me know if you have questions on anything and I'll do my best to respond.

Although the original one was great, I've improved a lot in the past two years and I can do better these days. That said, this one will serve as the toad's forever home. 

If you have the opportunity to keep these toads (preferably captive-bred specimens), I highly recommend housing them in a proper paludarium. It certainly doesn't have to be this elaborate, but trust me, the behaviors you'll witness are well worth the effort and money involved. These toads are absolute characters and are so much more personable in a proper setup. 

Anyway, enjoy the video and let me know what you thought about the build!

As of 09/16/2020, MJ is no longer with us. Truthfully, I knew it was only a matter of time given his age, but I'm legit heartbroken about it. 

I purchased him as a tadpole when I was about 15 years old. Although just a frog, the bond I shared with him was very special. I was there when he first emerged from the water as a young frog. I watched him grow and transform into a giant, beautiful creature with a big personality. It was such a wonderful experience and one that was unique to him. 

After the fact, I tend to think about what I could have done better or changed. I was content with this one though. I always treated him with kindness and respect. He truly will be missed.

Overall during that time I've had great success with a wide variety of different specimens. However, there was a fish I kept early on in my hobby that I wasn't experienced enough for. I only had it for around a year and a half. It did alright but never thrived as it should. It just so happens that this fish is also my all-time favorite. 

With the introduction of the 350 gallon paludarium, it's finally time to show one of the inhabitants. My favorite fish! It has to grow out for a little while prior to going in, which is why I'm showing it now. I have other fish in quarantine as well and the tank is already partially stocked. I'll share that in another video. In the meantime, enjoy this video!

I'm extremely excited to be at this point considering how long the tank took to setup. It's been in the works since October of 2019, but I didn't get the tank until January of 2020. It sat in my garage until July and I've been working on it ever since. If you want to see that journey in its entirety, then check out the playlist below.

I'm very excited to add this one to lineup and can't wait to see MJ in it! I really think he's going to enjoy the new paludarium. It's intentionally very similar to the previous. He made good use of that one and this is basically a larger, perfected version of it. 

Even in the 2-3 weeks the tank has been setup the plants have really grown. I think that letting them root in and establish first will make all the difference in having success with the plants. Otherwise I'll most likely have a repeat of last time.

In this one I address all of the terrestrial and semi-aquatic plants. There's still a lot more I want to add, but I can't until I do more with the mechanics of the setup. You'll see more on that in a later video.

Since filming this video I've done a lot and can't wait to show you the final design. Stay tuned for the continued progress and check out the playlist below if you missed the previous installments of this journey.

You may be curious about the longevity of something like this. Like I said in the video, it's a similar concept to the millipede mountain terrarium. With appropriate plants it will last just as long as any other terrarium (indefinitely).

All of the Weathered Driftwood was purchased from SR Aquaristik. I was able to get photos of the pieces prior to buying them, which helped out immensely! Many of you ask where I buy hardscape materials and this is a GREAT resource for exactly that. I've used them for many of my previous builds and highly recommend it if you are looking for materials.

I'm really excited about this one and think it turned out great! I know Samson is really going to enjoy the extra space as well. Like I said in the video, I want to let the plants grow in and establish prior to adding him. Although he didn't ruin the plants in his current setup, you never know with these frogs. They have big personalities and don't care about how the scape looks lol! I'll follow up in a few weeks. 

Also be sure to check out the original video if you missed it. It's a little more DIY oriented if you prefer builds like that.

I've had this one planned for while, but I kept putting it off because I wanted to do it right. All things considered, I think it turned out great! It's made completely from reclaimed and scrap materials I already had laying around the house. The only items I had to get were the glass, cherry slab and the liquid rubber. 

I think this was an easy build, but the process could be made simpler by cutting a hole in a table that's already built. All you would need to do is cut the hole and make a terrarium box. Once the box is made attach it to the table and recess it slightly so you don't have to make the groove later with a router. Use some method to waterproof the setup and you'll be in business!

I knew exactly what type of scape I wanted to do, I just didn't have the resources to do it until now. Even still, I was somewhat limited given the current circumstances. I was primarily working with materials I already had on hand. As usual I'll just adjust, add and fine tune things over time until I get it looking how I want.

Regardless, I think it turned out fairly well and I love the way the fish interact with the scape! They really came to life and their colors are finally starting to show through (especially in the past few days since I filmed this). These are a very striking fish if you look closely - subtle beauty if you will. Look up ""Volcano Rasbora"" on Google and you'll see what I mean.

I've been getting comments like this for awhile now and I've done mini updates, but a full blown tour/update hasn't happened in years. I figured now was the the perfect time for a longer format episode that goes through just about everything! While editing though, I realized how much I left out... that's alright. For another time I guess!

If you're new to the channel you may be wondering how I made these setups. Well, you're in luck! I have an instructional videos on EVERY PROJECT you saw. Just go through the archives and search for whatever you want to see or ask in the comments. I'll link up what I can. 

A common theme with a lot of my projects is me saying they need redone or replaced. I know many of you don't like that, but you have to understand it from my perspective. I'm trying to do the absolute best I can for my animals and make the most beautiful/functional enclosures possible. The issue is that I keep improving and inevitably old projects must go. Just know that I repurpose as much as I can and very little, if anything, goes to waste. 

With that you should know that I care a lot about the quality of care I provide for my animals. I know it may seem like I have a lot, but I rarely add to the collection and focus most of my time on improving their lives or improving my skills through other projects. Also realize that I have been doing this for a really long time. I've been building this collection for over 20 years.

The tank measures 17.5x12x12"" (12"" in the back and 7.5"" in the front to be specific). It also holds about 6 gallons of water. I think it turned out really well considering that I didn't have much to work with. 

As I explained in the video I wanted to keep it simple below the waterline and complex above. I wanted to keep as much of the stone visible as possible, while also maximizing the space for some critters. Hopefully I can stock it soon, but I can't at the moment. I really think you're going to like my plans. 

Anyway let me know what you thought about the finished design!

UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Last July I teamed up with the folks at Aquascape and Tussey Landscaping to build an Ecosystem Pond in my front yard. That was an incredible time and I made great friends in the process. We all made videos on our channels, which I've linked below.

It was near the end of the season when we built the pond, so it was only enjoyed for a few months. During that time I stocked it with fish and planted a variety of foliage. How did everything fare during the colder months though? Let's find out in this update!

I don't know about you, but I think it turned out extremely well! I really like how much of a feature the waterfall portion of the design is and I enjoy how the light shines through. What do you think?

Long-term I want to add plants to the water area as I eluded to in the video. However, I didn't have anything that I thought would look appropriate in this setup. I wish I would of had a few taller plants (like syngonium), but I could always add those later on as well. 

Also, what should I stock it with? I want you to decide! Leave your best suggestion in the comments for something suitable for a setup of this size. I'll take the best/highest liked suggestions and do a poll in about a month.

As I said in the video, I started it back in 2018 and quickly lost interest in the build

Two years later and my interest has been rekindled. I saw it the other day and came up with the idea I executed in this video. I'm glad I waited as long as I did to finish it because I think it turned out great! What do you think?

213		j2WnzJz4DEs	Make a Native Terrarium #withme (Satisfying & Relaxing Build)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"With mostly everyone stuck at home, I figured now was the perfect time to show a project anyone could replicate. What better than a native terrarium? No need to go out or order things when you likely have everything needed in your house and backyard. 

If you're unfamiliar with these, we refer to them as native terrariums because they are composed of items local or native to your area. Think of it as capturing a slice of nature specific to your yard. Getting outside to collect materials and build is also a great way to destress and bring the beauty of nature indoors for year long enjoyment. 

Although I presented this video in an ASMR no voice over format, I have videos that detail this process. I followed the same procedures used for the $0 Free Terrarium video: https://youtu.be/KR2Lo0rOF7g. I recommend watching that video if this is something you'd like to make. Two years later and that terrarium is still going strong! That video of course is a modification of my native terrarium from How to Terrarium episode 3: https://youtu.be/s6DnKCnlSxE.

If you're familiar with my other builds you may wonder why I didn't add charcoal or springtails to this one. Charcoal helps create the optimal environment within a terrarium and increases the likelihood of success. Although extremely beneficial, it's not a requirement. If you have it, add it. If not, don't stress and move to the next step. As for springtails, they help create a natural decomposition cycle and mitigate issues with mold. When using components from outside, you're pretty much guaranteed that springtails will take up residence. They hitchhike on the materials.

That leads to one of my top FAQs, “my terrarium is full of white stringy mold, what should I do?” Getting mold in a newly established terrarium is almost a grantee, especially if you include wood or botanicals. DON'T STRESS! This is easy remedied. Like I said previously, springtails and charcoal will help. Without either of those though, the easiest way around it is with manual removal. I like to use my tweezers for that job. After a week or two of consistently removing it, the terrarium will gain equilibrium and the mold will dissipate.

Another common FAQ is, “what plants should I use?” My first recommendation of course is moss. 9/10 it will acclimate to and thrive in a terrarium with only a few exceptions. If you live somewhere tropical, then anything will work. That said, choose plants that stay small or be prepared to consistently trim them so they don't outgrow the space. If you live somewhere temperate (like me) I've found that the best ones to use are evergreen plants (stay green year round). Otherwise they will thrive initially, but won't last long-term. Again, choose plants that stay small or be prepared to trim. Lastly DO NOT use succulent or cactus plants. They will not work in a closed environment. 

Hopefully that bit of insight will help you get started. If you have any comments, suggestions or questions, leave them down in the comments! For additional content like this, photos of my terrariums, projects sneak peeks and more, follow me on Instagram and TikTok @SerpaDesign.

In this one I just wanted to give you a quick update on my plans for the animal room before I really start to get into a lot of projects. Like I said in the video, I have a lot of materials on hand already, so I should be able to do a lot in the next few weeks. 

I'm going to try and release some bonus content for the next few weeks. Is that something you'd be interested in and if so, what would you like to see? I have a lot of ideas already, but I'm curious about what you think. Let me know! Already had a lot of great feedback on a post I put up the other day in the community tab. 

Also, I'm just about done building the framework for the 75 gallon rack. I've been filming that whole process in case it's something you'd want to see an extensive video about. If so, let me know! Hopefully I can have those tanks set up soon... you're going to love them!

All I did was dismantle the aquarium, cut the panes shorter and put it back together. I already had all of the materials, so there was no upfront cost to built the enclosure. However, if you were to buy everything new it could be done for under $25 if you already have the tools. Otherwise it will be around $35. From there you can go as elaborate as you the paludarium to be. 

Something I didn't really explain in the video was the removable overflow tray. I made it in that way so I can service the pump if needed. I'll have to move things around to access it, but it can easily be done without destroying the whole setup. I definitely recommend figuring that portion of your own builds before you get to far along.

Over time as the platform has grown, I've been faced with an interesting decision and opportunity. ""I have to quit"" I kept telling myself. For various reasons though I wouldn't actually go through with it. 

However, it became glaringly obvious that I needed to just go for it. This is what I've been planning for and the timing was right. So that's exactly what I did... I quit. As of March 1st 2020 I have been a full time Content Creator. It's been a very long and tiresome journey to this point, but it was well worth it. 

This is only the beginning and I'm just getting started. I know I've hardly scratched the surface of my creativity and what's possible with this form of art. I have so much planned and I'm working on a lot of things outside of this platform. 

Additionally we just got to 500,000 subscribers here on YouTube! I'll do something special for that next week, but I wanted to take a moment and thank you for being a huge part of what makes all of this possible. I feel very blessed to have the audience that I do and am thankful for each and every one of you. Thank you!!!

Obviously I haven't built one in a cloche container, but I also haven't shown anything with Dragon Stone. I figured while changing it up, why not add millipedes to the mix as well? 

I keep millipedes as part of the clean up crew in my gecko's vivarium and they seem to do a good job. They like to eat any left over food and waste. It doesn't seem like they nibble on the plants either. I suspect that's because they have a better food source. That in mind I will periodically open this container to care for them. Also, they're really fun to watch!

I think this build turned out really well and is quite unique. What do you think? Do you think it turned out well? Do you like the millipedes? Initially I was going to introduce isopods, but I felt that millipedes were better suited for this setup. 

A lot of you ask where I get my hardscape. As of late I've been buying a lot of pieces, including the Dragon Root in this video from the link below. I figured I'd throw that out there because I always get questions about it. https://sraquaristik.com/

As I said in the video, I think the combination of elements really come together to create something beautiful. Even with all of the details, the setup is quite simple. I think that's one of the reasons I enjoy this one. 

Here's a link to the tank I used in this video: https://bit.ly/2v9p7tI

I also like how the background turned out. It was an experiment, but I think it looks/functions well. I've shown methods similar to this using silicone, but it tends not to hold onto items long-term when submerged underwater. I believe that's due to the flexible nature of silicone. I'll show more about this technique in a future video. 

Should I put the catfish in this tank or something else? Let me know what you think!

I was waiting until I could find the perfect fish. I think the Microdevario kubotai (Green Kubotai Rasbora) are that fish. The catfish are just an added bonus, if they go in the same tank. Either way I'm very excited to add both to the lineup. More on them in a future video!

As I expressed in the video, I love how there's always something new to see with this hobby. In a way, it's kind of like going outside into nature. I just don't think it could ever get boring! Filming for orchids and then finding mushrooms was a prime example of what I mean.

Etc, etc. I get questions about this one more than probably any other setup in the animal room. As you can tell from the video it's doing extremely well. To this point I've thoroughly enjoyed it and so do the toads and fish. I know that to be the case since we're seeing breeding activity from both (note: I'll try and record some of that for next time I show the tank).

A few things I forgot to mention in the video: I keep the top of the tank sealed up with a piece of polycarbonate drilled for ventilation holes in the back. This helps keep the tank very humid, which means I never have to mist the setup. Also I had a lot of negative comments about the ""chemicals"" I used in the build video. Once cured all of them are chemically inert and have no affect on the environment. That should be evident since everything is thriving. 

Let me know what you think about the current setup and what you would do moving forward! Part of me wants to redo it and part of me doesn't. I don't want to redo because the animals like it, but I want to redo because I know I could make something that looks betters and functions better for the animals.

I can't say that all have been successful, but I think that many of them have been my best works to date. I'm always trying to push the boundary of what's possible with these mediums and push the boundary of what I'm capable of. I think that 2019 has been a great year for all of that.

I truly do appreciate all that you do for this channel! Without your interaction and continued support I would not be where I am today. As I've said before, I can put in the work, but if no one's watching, no one's watching. Since you are watching though, I'll put my all into what I do.

I know that many of you have better setups because of the content I've made, while others simply watch for the sake of entertainment. Either way, I honestly believe that what I do makes the world a better place in some small way. I know that's the case based on all of the comments I've received over the years about how my videos have been a positive influence on your life. That's not an idea I came up with on my own. Maybe my motto of 2020 should be, ""The world would be a better place if everyone would terrarium."" 

Anyway what I'm trying to say is THANK YOU! Sometimes I get a long winded... I can't wait to show you what I have planned for 2020. I've hardly scratched the surface of what's possible! Expect more aquariums, paludariums, terrariums and lot of new ideas that just aren't on the platform (yet). 

Peace and love SerpaSquad! May you all have an awesome 2020.

There are a lot of ways that I could have done this, but I feel that transforming a baseball bat display case into a terrarium was a great idea. As I said I bought the case for $5.99 at a thrift store almost two years ago. I wasn't sure what to do with it until the other day. 

I think this one turned out really well and love the fact that it was an upcycled project. I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND going to a thrift store or flea market to find containers and other items for your builds. I always find the best things when I do.

For some reason when I saw the round shape I immediately thought of making a riparium complete fogger / mist maker. The way this turned out is slightly different than my initial vision, but I like how it turned out nonetheless. 

My goal was to make something that resembled the edge of a river or pond. I think I achieved this desired look. Something neat about this project is that's it's two in one. It looks completely different with and without the fog / mist.

232		Yg-qA3IkOj8	My Terrarium Tool Box & How to Choose the Right Utensils	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"“What tools do you use and why? What tools would you recommend for a beginner? What's in your terrarium tool box?” All of those questions and more are answered in this video. 

I've been getting questions about it for years now and figured it was finally time to share my terrarium tool box. It's a great thing to have when you're working on as many projects as I do. It helps me stay organized and work through projects as optimally as possible. That said, keep in mind that I use a lot of other materials that are kept elsewhere. Also, like I said in the video I got the tackle box at TJ Maxx years ago. I couldn't find the same one online, but if you search “Art Supply Tool Box” you can find similar items. Here's a link to the closest thing I could find: https://amzn.to/2qE5Uyb

Selecting your utensils will depend a lot on what you're creating. However, as I said in the video, there are a few items (a poker, brush, tweezers and scissors) that I believe are essential to the process if you want to be as effective as possible. You could probably get all four of them for less than $20 collectively. Additionally, just because someone wants to sell you an expensive tool doesn't mean that it's right for the job. Be inventive and make you own when you can! 

I've linked up some of the items from the video I get the most questions about. Unfortunately I couldn't link the same aquascaping scissors as they're no longer available. I linked what I could find. Also, I highly recommend looking around to find the best deal. I did a quick search to find some of what I'm using and similar items to give you some inspiration. Leave me a comment if you need help finding something else.

233		1AH8vp2MJb0	The Carnivorous Sundew Terrarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"It's finally time for another terrarium build! In this one I'm making the highly requested sundew terrarium. This one is similar to the venus flytrap in ways and different in others. Regardless the end result is a simple and elegant terrarium that showcases the sundew (Drosera tokaiensis). 

As I explained in the video, sundew will thrive in inert substrate free of minerals with bright light and humidity. Also use water that doesn't' have any minerals. If you can provide these and a dormancy period for applicable species, then you should have success. If you want to make a terrarium for them, I'd recommend building it around the plant and think of everything else as a visual enhancement. 

Again as I say with most things, if these and other carnivorous plants are something that interest you, do some research! There is a lot of information out there that I just can't touch on in a video like this. 

Material List:
Black Lava Rock
Distilled Water
Geotextile Fabric
Glass Container
Substrate (Coco Fiber/Peat, Quarts Sand, Sphagnum Moss)

Plant List: 
Acorus gramineus 'Minimus Aureus'
Drosera tokaiensis
Ficus pumila 'Quercifolia'
Marchantia polymorpha (Liverwort)
Saxifraga stolonifera (Strawberry Begonia)
Selaginella kraussiana 'Gold Tips'
Sphagnum Moss
Taxiphyllum 'Flame' (Flame Moss)

234		XztCLxUiQbM	I Made a Bonsai Tree (w/ Ficus salicifolia)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"""Make a bonsai tree!"" I've been getting requests to do this non-stop for the past three years from many of you. I've always been very intrigued by bonsai and was ready to try. I've had trees in the past that I couldn't keep alive, but that was before I had a green thumb... That's not to say I'm guaranteed success with this one, but you gotta start somewhere. Right? 

Keep in mind that I'm only getting started. I'm already not content with the way I designed my tree, but I suppose that's no different than any of my other projects. I suppose I can always adjust it later on and experiment with future projects. The take away though is that I had a great time doing it and I can't wait to do it again! I also can't wait to learn more and share of the ideas I've been cooking up. 

Having fun is the theme of my work. I do the best I can at any given time and always strive to improve. At the same time I enjoy the now and the process of creating. In my mind, every project should be worlds better than the previous (assuming it's something I've done previously). It keeps things fresh, keeps me motivated and helps me challenge myself. 

Also, it should come as no surprise that I love trees! When I found out about TeamTrees I knew I wanted to be a part of it.  I've been holding off mentioning it in a video as I knew this would be an appropriate topic. If you want to help plant 20,000,000 trees by 2020, then check out the link and learn more about Team Trees! https://teamtrees.org/

235		7c2pbTOMe7c	Making a Moss Garden from Scratch (Satisfying & Relaxing)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I've been wanting to make a dish moss garden for quite awhile now. I figured I would do it a little differently with this one and present it in a long format, relaxing type of video. I think the video speaks for itself, but I'll outline the process below to give you a better idea of what's happening. 

I started by building the glass dish. This is built exactly the same as my DIY aquariums. If you want more information on this process, then I recommend watching this video https://youtu.be/45bZ7lplBj0 It's really easy once you get past the learning curve of cutting glass. Alternatively you could use something like an acrylic organizer tray.

Once the dish was built I set up the garden. I started by integrating Capillary Rope. These ropes will pull the water in the false bottom up to the moss and help keep it hydrated between watering. Then I made a sand false bottom, which was followed by a layer of activated carbon (charcoal). Everything was topped off with my tropical substrate mix and finally the moss. In case you're wondering, this one features five different types of moss including Badge Moss, Fern Moss, Haircap Moss, Hypnum Moss and Thread Moss. 

The long-term maintenance of this setup is very simple. The dish just needs watered once a day to keep the moss hydrated. Longer “drought” periods can be implemented, but constant hydration will produce optimal results. As for lighting pretty much any LED will get the job done. I typically use something in the 900-2500 lumen range, but most lights should work. 

Check out the videos below for more content on moss that could help get you started.

Updates on the ponds, baby fish, stocking the DIY mini pond and the gargoyle gecko vivarium! If you've been waiting to see any of this, then I hope you'll really enjoy this one. 

As you would expect I thoroughly enjoy making my setups, but it's always fun to get the animals in their homes and see how they thrive long-term. I think this video helps showcase that, but it's something I'd like to start sharing more in a format like this. If you wouldn't mind, let me know if you like a video like this.

Also I'm sure you could tell that a lot is about to change in the animal room. Stay tuned! I've got big tanks coming in and a lot of really cool setups.

I've been getting requests to make one for awhile now and truthfully I didn't plan on making one any time soon. However, when I found an awesome planter on clearance for $10, I knew what needed to be done - Make a patio pond (or what I call an indoor pond because I'm not putting it on my patio)! 

Then came the opportunity to get Orange Rice Fish. I wanted to make something truly beautiful that will really showcase the fish. That's where this new mini pond comes into play. What do you think? Can't you picture the contrast of bright orange against the green plants? I can. We'll follow up with that in a few weeks though.

It also didn't cost very much. Collectively it was probably only around $50 USD.

Like I said in the video I wanted to keep this one simple and minimal. Long-term it will of course fill in and look fuller, but the vision is for it to remain clean. 

As promised here's the material and plant list. I linked up what made sense, but the others are on you. Also everything other than the Bucephalandra I sourced from my backyard.

The channel wouldn't have kept growing if I didn't keep uploading and if you weren't watching. That's usually why I take a moment to thank you all when I upload the updates for this terrarium. So thanks again for everything! None of this would be possible without all of you! 

Anyway, enjoy the update and let me know what you think about the progress. Also if you're new here, be sure to check out the original build video and previous updates linked below.

I've been getting requests to do this for awhile now, but say no more because it's here! I had a lot of fun doing this one and I hope that it works out long-term. Obviously it's somewhat experimental, but I don't see any reason why this shouldn't work. Time will tell! 

I should mention that some of the plants used were grown immersed, so you may have noticed some melting leaves near the end of the video. That's nothing to worry about though. It just has to run its course until we get some acclimated underwater plant growth.

While there I got the opportunity to set up a 500 gallon paludarium for Greg Wittstock the Pond Guy! This was the largest tank I've done excluding the ponds, so it was a daunting task. That said a lot of the smaller builds I do are way more challenging than something of this size.

I also got the chance to network with a lot of cool people. Definitely some potential collabs on the horizon if that's something that interests you. Anyway enjoy the video and I'll catch you all next week!

I've been planning to build a tank like this for awhile now... we'll call this one a happy accident since I broke the tank. Initially I wanted to just make it a rimless tank, but my vision was always for it to be a pond themed tank. What's that entail? A lot of riparian growth and a lot of floating plants! Let it grow in some and you'll see my vision unfold. 

Once this tank is established and running well it will be stocked with something nano. Like I said in the video, I already have a good idea of what I want, but I'm open to suggestions (other than a betta). Let me know in the comments! 

Plant List: 
Acorus graminius 'Minimus Aureus'
Alternanthera ficoidea 'Christmas Tree'
Anubias nana 'Petite'
Hemigraphis repanda
Ludwigia repens 'Rubin'

All three are doing extremely well and I'm excited to share their progress with you. As I'm sure can imagine, I'm thoroughly enjoying the ponds and the 180 is by far one of my favorite setups (for now). 

I know that a lot you are probably wondering why I take so long to stock my setups. It's much better to take your time and do it right the first time! I've had issues happen in the past when I was hasty about it and why rush? The safety of the animals and integrity of my designs are the top priorities.

The reason I say that is because I've had the 180 set up for a little longer than a year and I still haven't set it up. Why? Like I've explained in previous videos, I'm constantly working in it and fine-tuning to achieve the look I envisioned. I'd rather not bother the dart frogs all the time, so I'll hold off until the setup is done... it's very close! And to answer the title of the video, yes it can and will get better. 

I'm also taking my time stocking the new Aquascape Ecosystem Pond with the natives. Although I want to free up space in the animal room it's not worth rushing the fish into their new home if it's not ready for them. I'll probably do that in a few weeks though.

249		Vb_r4iSsDo8	Building an INCREDIBLE POND with the PROS	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Having one pond was great, but much like a fish tank, terrarium or vivarium... it's even better to have two (or more)! That's why the folks at Aquascape and I teamed up to bring you another pond build. The funny thing is that after I uploaded the DIY pond build, a lot of you were saying that I should collab with Greg. By the time the requests started flooding in, him and I already had this one planned out. In doing so I had a GREAT time. These are all genuine, like-minded people who are awesome at what they do. 

As you probably expected, that means that the native fish are moving outside to live the Aquascape Lifestyle. They'll be happier out there anyways and we can do much more interesting things in the animal room (stuff you've NEVER seen before). Stay tuned! 

I know I'll get a lot of comments about how expensive these ponds are. Although it would definitely be more expensive to do something like this, realize that you're primarily paying for a CAC (Certified Aquascape Contractor). The kit and other materials really aren't that expensive compared to something similar. So if you can learn the process (they have the resources to do so), then you could certainly make something like this or bigger for a decent price, especially since there's no guess work or development involved. Had I known that to begin with, I may have went the ecosystem pond route for the one out back. Something I didn't talk about in that video is that I wasted a decent amount of money because I had to troubleshoot and design everything from scratch. Regardless of what you do, I'd highly recommend that you get a pond of some kind.

Here's the kit that we used to build this pond: https://www.aquascapeinc.com/products/small-pond-kit-8x11

A HUGE thanks to the folks over at Tussey Landscaping and Soergel Landscape. They really pulled through for this build and we couldn't have done it without them. If you're looking for more pond content, I'd highly recommend checking out their channel and the other items I have linked below.

250		CwVwi0QebvI	These Isopods are AWESOME	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Introducing some new isopods... and some other miscellaneous updates. The isopods came courtesy of Justin and Peter of Dart Knight Exotics. They sent these as a way to showcase just a few of the captive bred isopods they offer. The same are showcased on the poster that was made in collaboration with ZTHphoto. Watch the video and see the below links for details. 

ALSO I apologize for the buzzing sound throughout the video. I was having issues with my mic that I didn't notice until I started editing the video.

Isopods are really neat and something that aren't “just for kids” anymore. This is a serious hobby that a lot of people are getting into that also goes hand in hand with everything else I show on the channel. I'd imagine that most people watching this video like/own isopods of their own. Even if you don't or don't intend on doing so, hopefully you can appreciate those little “rollie pollies” next time you see them. They are a very important component to most ecosystems, which is why they are so heavily implemented in bioactive setups. Some of them also look pretty cool as well. 

You can use promo code “serpa15” on ZTHphoto's entire Etsy store and on all of Dart Knight Exotics. Like I said in the video, I don't receive compensation. This is just for your personal use if you're interested.

The pond still isn't entirely complete, but we've got fish in it now. This pond was build specifically for the group of fish that I already have, so I am very excited that they're finally in their new home along with 11 new additions. 

On a side note, Goldfish (specifically long-bodied) are some of my favorite fish. I don't care what anyone says, goldfish are the PERFECT fish for this pond and one of the best fish period! They have big personalities, are beautiful and are easy to care for. What more could you want in a fish? I know they tend to have the stigma of being a ""dirty fish"" but I think they are actually a cleaner fish. I think this comes from people keeping them in homes that are too small or inadequately filtered. They constantly sift through the substrate, which makes debris more likely to be captured by the filter.Anyways, enough of my tangent... I just love these fish! 

Part 1: https://youtu.be/TeHybQPz7RE

Again, a huge thanks for Oase for supplying the pumps! It was a huge burden off of me and was really appreciated. I'm using the Waterfall Pump 1650 for the skimmer and will be using AquaMax Eco Premium 3000 for the rest. I'll talk more about those in the next video and put some links below.

I'm usually apprehensive about adoptions because I need to make sure it's an animal that I'm interested in keeping and that I'm equipped to keep. That said, being able to bring in an animal and make it feel welcome is something special. 

From what I was told this gecko was never completely welcomed anywhere it went. I find that to be very sad, but the truth is that reptiles aren't for everyone. Of course we want people to keep and love their animals for the duration of their lives, but things happen or people loose interest. Sometime giving them up is the responsible thing to do. Like I said in the video, if you find yourself in a situation like that, finding a better home is the best thing you can do. 

Anyways, I'm very excited to bring aboard our newest addition! We'll set her up in a proper bioactive setup very soon. Also let me know if you have any name suggestions.

253		fZKxSt7h9Ok	Building The Pixie Frog (African Bullfrog) Paludarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"The African Bullfrog paludarium is finally here! I know this one's been ongoing for awhile, but I had my reasons. Samson was fine in his previous setup, so there was no rush to complete this and it kept getting put aside for more time sensitive builds. That said, I'm very pleased to finally have it done and I think Samson is as well! 

My goal with this one was not necessarily to mimic the ABF's natural habitat per-say, but to create something that takes the essence of it and showcases the animal. I really like how all of my paludariums turned out, but I think that this one is the best at showcasing the animal in all of its glory. Just look at how proper he looks swimming through the water and snatching prey off the embankment! 

For the record frogs are my favorite! They are what got me started on all of this and my oldest lived animal to date was my ABF Gunther. I had him for well over 14 years, but unfortunately he passed away a few years back. These animals are just so incredible that I couldn't last long without getting another... that of course being Samson. He's only about 2 years old now, but they have been recorded to live up to 40 years! He's also only about half size. Adult males will max out around 8-10”. These animals are incredible for a number of other reasons as well. I've linked up some must watch videos down below in case you are new to the African Bullfrog (aka Pixie Frog).

254		TeHybQPz7RE	DIY Backyard Garden Pond	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"The pond build is finally here! I've been talking about this for months and thought that it would have been done about a month ago, but the whole thing is just so time consuming, especially with the weather we've been having. Like I said in the video, this has been going on since October of 2018 and was just a concept long before that. The whole reason that I even built this is for my goldfish, so stocking in non-negotiable... other than more goldfish lol (4 won't be enough). 

This is only the first part of a few video series and I hope it gives you a good idea as to what's possible outside the realm of naturalistic ponds. Obviously that's what we all want, but sometimes it's just not feasible because of cost. Even though it's not the same type of thing, these kind of ponds can still be beautiful in their own sort of way. Plus you can create a good home for your beloved fish, which is often what it's all about.

There's so much more I could say, but the video should be able to do most of the talking. If you have any specific questions or want to see something else in the next installment, please let me know down in the comments. This one took forever, so I really hope you enjoy it.

I knew I had to pull out all the stops for this one. A lot of you actually were requesting that I set one of these up as well, so it was a win win. I don't think I've seen another bioactive biOrb either... It had to be done. I also incorporated a lot of rare and oddball plants that I've had on deck for a while. I'll let the video do the rest of the talking from here. 

Like I said in the video I haven't had a chance to use it for very long, so I can't give a full assessment at this time. I'll follow up in a few months though to show you the growth and let you know what my thoughts are. That said, my initial impression is that I really like it. If I determine that it's a solid piece, then we'll talk about stocking it with some more critters... PDFs anyone? 

In case you wanted to learn more about the biOrb AIR or were looking to buy one for yourself, check out the links below! Just linking it up for you. I do not get any kind of compensation for it.

256		bmqqRP7OJfE	How to Clean and Quarantine Terrarium Plants	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"“Can you tell us more about how you clean plants and the quarantine process?” Yes I finally will! I must have received this request hundreds of times by now. I knew it was one that couldn't last much longer and truthfully I intended to do much sooner. This was definitely one of my most requested videos, but I couldn't make it until circumstances were right on my end. For those of you who kept asking, I appreciate your patience. 

I've not talked about it much in detail, but I have dropped bits here and there in various videos. Simply put, unless you're making a native terrarium, you really should take some precautions with ANY plants you've purchased (in my opinion). The issue is that plants can introduce contaminants into your setups if not properly taken care of. Contaminants such as pesticides, chemical fertilizers, pests and germs. That said, you can usually get away with a really basic clean when it comes to terrarium plants. However, if you are making a setup for animals, you definitely want to take extra precautions to ensure the well being of your beloved animals. 

Like I said in the video, cleaning the plants is really great and should get a plant good to go in a lot of instances. However, you really won't know for sure without taking time to observe the plant in quarantine, so I highly recommend it. That's not to say that every little thing which could come in with plants is detrimental, but that you want to use plants that are sterile as physically possible. The less variables you can have with your builds, the easier they are to construct and maintain. In other words, there will be less troubleshooting or room for error. 

The video goes into a lot of detail on all of this though. If you have additional questions or want clarification on what I discussed in the video, be sure to leave a comment! I'll do my best to get back to you, but can't make any guarantees. Also, as promised, check out the list of websites below for places to get plants online. It really DOES NOT MATTER where you get them. What matters is what you do when you get them. (Note: I have no affiliation with any of these sites)

I've been caught up it in a lot of projects right now, so I think a simple terrarium was due. Like I said in the video I have a ton of containers to choose from, but I wanted to do something basic for this one. Although I make a ton of different terrariums on here, sometimes the simple ones are the most effective. You don't need to go overboard (even though it's fun) to make something beautiful.

No. ""Is super glue really safe for this type of setup?"" Yes. ""How is this doing today?"" Great and I think you get the idea. 

I had to do a little maintenance and add some more riparian plants, so I figured now was a good time to do the 6 month update. As you'll see in the video, Casper the Amano Shrimp are doing really well and enjoy this setup. This video really shows off how spunky Casper really is as well! 

Also it is actually blackwater this time around. In the initial video I said that it needed more tannins to look proper, but I still had a lot of folks commenting that it wasn't even blackwater, etc. Well there's no question about it now and Casper no doubt is the perfect candidate for this type of tank.

259		_ImuURHDYbw	The MOST SPECIAL Terrarium EVER (Our Wedding)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"This has to be the most special terrarium project that I've shown thus far. I've made a lot of terrariums in my time and have shown countless designs on this channel. However, I can't say that I've done one like this before. I also can't say that there will be another one like it. Not from us at least.

When we were coming up with ideas for our unity ceremony, a few ideas were thrown around. There were the standard candle and thread ceremonies, among others. However, we later came up with the idea to make a unity terrarium. It almost didn't happen, but we knew it would be something really unique and special. Not only that, but it perfectly represents the concept of unity in a relationship and it's something that we can have as a keepsake. Perhaps someday we may even pass the it onto our children. 

Ironically, one of the first bonding activities that Alyssa and I did some time ago was make a terrarium. In fact it's the oldest one in my collection and we still have it to this day. There's always been something special about it because we made together. Making a unity terrarium really brought things full circle as well and took us back to an earlier time. It also brought us together and was the perfect precursor to our wedding day. 

Although they're just a jar with plants and such in them, they really are so much more than that. They can bring people together, they can be a fun hobby, something that reconnects you with nature or even a symbol of love. The list goes on, but in my opinion terrariums transcend art and I think the world would be a better place if everyone would terrarium! 

I don't share this kind of thing with you lightly, but I am really invested in this platform. YouTube is a huge part of my life as was this moment. You all have done so much for us by continually supporting the channel. As such, I knew we couldn't get married without sharing it with you! I knew that so many of you would appreciate being a part of this moment and perhaps get an idea for you own unity ceremony ;) 

A HUGE thanks Aaron + Craig (video) and Anne (thumbnail pic) of Loyalty Entertainment for capturing our special day and this moment! www.loyaltyentertains.com

Another thanks to Rev. Mark for making the ceremony so special! He really did a great job keeping everyone engaged and loved the unity terrarium. https://www.asimplevow.org/

Like I said in the video there are several containers like this though. I just chose the one that I felt would make the best project and I think it turned out great!

Long term I have high expectations for this one and I think it will do well. I don't think it's going to have the same issues that the terrarium in an aquarium had, but I guess time will tell.

I've been getting requests and questions about this for some time and as I said in replies, I'll do it at some point. It took awhile to make it happen, but I had my reasons. After all was said and done I think we ended up with an awesome tank! 

If this is something that interests you, I definitely encourage you to give it a try. I can't guarantee that all them will work, but it's worth experimentation on your part. I would advise against using pillow moss and large hair cap moss (see the below video for more info on that).

It's been really nice outside and I just had to get out of the studio and bring you some candid content, from the outdoors. I've also pretty much depleted my moss reserves, so this is the perfect opportunity to stock up. Let's get mossy! 

I know this one doesn't go as in depth on identifying moss as some of you may have liked, but I quickly realized this would have way more of a project than I anticipated, if I had. That said, I'll definitely do a dedicated video on it when I can find the time. Until then, I hope that the tips I gave in this video will help you at least get started. 

For those of you wondering, most and I mean most mosses will work in a terrarium or vivarium. The propagation method that's linked below closely resembles that of a terrarium. With it, I've been able to grow everything except for some (not all) haircap and pillow mosses. That's why I don't recommend them. Additionally, the only one from this video that's hit or miss is hypnum moss. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I pretty much always has success with the others though. 

Propagate Moss: https://youtu.be/CleZGsQGIOI

I get asked a lot how to grow moss and I usually reference that video because there's not much to it. Light + Water = Happy Patches of Moss! Don't over think it. Aside from thoroughly cleaning them before use and trimming over time, there's not much else I do for them other than that. More light and more water is better than not enough. However, mosses are very resilient and will adapt to various conditions, regardless of the type. 

I think that about covers everything I can think of for the moment. If you have any further questions, be sure to leave a comment and I'll do my best to get back to you!

In this video I hope to give you a better idea of who I am and why I do what I do. There not much I have to say on that though. The video explains it all. 

I do however need to thank you all again for the latest milestone. 250,000, a quarter of a million, are you kidding me? That's honestly so crazy to me. I can't believe that many of you are interested in what is that I do. I know that it will only keep growing from here, but I can't say it enough.

I've been meaning to do this for a few weeks and since it was finally time to get the Venus Fly Trap Terrarium going again, it was the perfect time to make this video. 

As you saw the majority of the terrariums are still doing well. I'll most certainly do videos on the redos when the time comes. Also I know I'll get questions about them, but all of the other terrariums I didn't show in this video as still doing really well. I only showed ones in this video that needed maintenance or redone. 

I'm sure that there's more I could say, but I'll let the video do all of the talking. Also, as promised, here's the link to the Terrarium Builds Playlist. Again if you want to learn how to build any of the terrariums you saw in this video, then this is the place to go!

Like I said in the video, the first was intended to be an angled tank like this, but I decided to save it for another build once I got started. Here's a link to that video in case you missed it: https://youtu.be/45bZ7lplBj0

I really like how this one turned out as well. What do you think? Looking at it now, I think I'm going to add some botanicals. I could have added more plants, but I like the negative space created by the lack of plants in certain areas. However, I think that botanicals will elevate the design, without taking away from that feature. 

Believe it or not a lot of plants will work in this type of setting. Just look for things that like soggy/wet soil or grow in or near bodies of water in nature (i.e. marginal plants). Most aquarium plants will also do really well in a setup like this, but you will most likely have to gradually acclimate them to the open air.

As promised, here is the Plant List: Syngonium podophyllum (variegated), Rabbit's Foot Fern,  Alternanthera ficoidea, Purple Waffle Plant, Cryptocoryne wendtii 'Bronze', Tillandsia ionantha 'Red', Salvinia Minima, Micromeria brownei, Ludwigia Narrowleaf, Liverwort and Badge Moss

Lastly, I figured it might be useful to share a video on cutting glass. It's really easy to do and something I won't make a video on. However, this is the best one that I could find on it: https://youtu.be/hIWfvgDJ3JE

I've been getting requests for those from time to time and this sort of fulfills that request. This type of maintenance does not constitute what I do from week to week, as I pretty much just change water, occasionally trim plants and dose liquid ferts. Perhaps it gives some perspective on how I keep these looking crispy.

In case you're wondering, all of these tanks are low-tech. As such I'm not needing to trim them every other day, but the plants are not as lush as they could be if I were to go hi-tech (inject CO2). That said, I'm perfectly fine taking my time with these and caring for them in a low-tech manner. 

Additionally all of these scapes were pretty cheap to setup. I'm not using top of the line gear here and I'd say most of the money goes toward hardscape, substrate and filtration. I'd estimate that each of these cost anywhere from $50-$100 to setup, but most likely in the $75 range. The only reason that I mention that, is you don't need a ton of money to create stuff like this. 90% of what you see on my channel is made from repurposed items or things that I bargained for. Be creative and you can make beautiful art on a budget. 

As promised, below is the PLANT LIST

Anubias nana 'petite', Anubias 'short & sharp', Bolbitis heudelotii, Bolbitis heteroclita difformis, Bucephalandra 'blue', Cabomba, Creeping Charlie, Cryptocoryne wendtii 'green' and 'red', Hygrophila polysperma 'sunset', Java Fern Rotala indica and Süßwassertang

Like I said in the video, this might not be what some of you had in mind, but we'll make a more traditional ecosphere at some point in the future. Anyways, there's not much else to say. I'll let the video do the talking from here on out. Enjoy!

Although I like to make videos in that way, they don't show the beauty of the process itself, which I think is very important.

Admittedly this video didn't turn out how I initially planned, but it still does a good job fulfilling my vision. Originally there wasn't going to be music and it would be considered an ASMR video. Unfortunately I could not remove all of the background noise in post and I found it to be very annoying. That's part of the reason why most of my videos have been scripted as of late, but that's a topic for another time. 

I personally view terrariums as an art form and I wanted to showcase the process in that way. I think people tend to look past the process (for most things) and only want results. The process is often just as beautiful as the outcome.

I've had my eye on these tanks for a little while now and I decided to finally get one to turn into a paludarium. I knew that I wanted to do something unique with it and a paludarium seemed like the right thing to do.

All in all I like how it turned out, but as I said in the video, I'm definitely going to fine tune the setup as I go, so that it's perfect. I'll definitely adjust the waterfall (to increase flow) and perhaps the plants. That said, I want to let the them grow in some before I do anything. 

By the way, this video is not sponsored and I purchased the tank. It's a neat little aquarium and not really suitable for any animals (excluding something like seed shrimp), but it's cool for making little novelty builds like this. Here's a link to where I bought it: https://minicompletetank.com/

I've been planning this one out since I got the suggestions awhile ago and I knew it had to be done. This was by far one of the most challenging terrarium builds I've done to date and I'm sure it won't be the last. Let me rephrase that, it will probably be the first/last Klein Bottle terrarium, but not the last challenging build. 

I don't have much to say other than that. I hope that you enjoy this build because it wasn't easy to pull off. In fact, I almost didn't do it, but I pushed through and made it happen. Enjoy!

273		IEzWmyLJTf0	Will Dried Moss Return to Life?	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Welcome back everyone! In this one we'll upgrade a few of my setups and remove the terrarium from the terrarium in an aquarium. As I said in the video, this wasn't an easy decision to make because once it's out, it's out. However, the more time went on I felt that it was the right thing to do for a number of reasons. The fish will have a larger volume of water to enjoy, the aquarium will look nicer and the tank can be rescaped/planted to some degree. 

With the above in mind, I will most like use a few seiryu stones and some driftwood to spice up the scape. I'm not sure about the wood, but definitely the stones. Keep in mind that I want to retain the hardscape that's there currently and simply add to it. I know the aquarium isn't much to look at now, but it will be magnificent in no time. If that's a process you'd like to see, let me know in the comments otherwise I'll just do it on my own.

I purchased the Dusk Moss Mix and the vivarium plants from https://www.glassboxtropicals.com/ They have a great selection of plants that always come in well. Definitely a good resource to use if you're in the market for plants, microfauna, hardscape or dusk moss of course. 

Also, the botanicals came from https://tanninaquatics.com/ They have an excellent selection of botanicals that are reasonably priced. If you've never ordered them before I'd recommend one of their enigma packs and let them know what type of setups you keep. They'll curate a bag full of botanicals specifically designed for your hobby.

274		9YC0BTdRFbs	How to Maintain an Awesome Paludarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I had to do maintenance on this setup and I knew a lot of you wanted to see that process, so I filmed it. Most of you also wanted to see a dedicated video on it. I didn't intent to do one, but once I got started I realized there was a lot I wanted to discuss.

Since I uploaded the video on this paludarium about three months back, I have consistently received questions about how I maintain it and how to maintain other paludariums. Truth is that they're usually pretty simple, but as I eluded to in the video, every setup is slightly different. You won't completely know what to do until you work with one first hand. What I'm trying to say is that just because you see something work for someone else doesn't mean that it will work for you. Even minor differences can changes everything. That said, videos like this can give you a good idea of where to begin and a lot of resources for your tool box. 

Now I don't say any of that to discourage you from starting. In fact I encourage you if this is something you want to do. My main thing is that you will learn much better by doing research and through trial and error than copying what others do, expecting success. 

Anyways, this paludarium is doing great! I'm really enjoying it and can't wait to see it continue to flourish. Something I didn't mention in the video is that I bought a variety of other botanicals that I will be adding to the water feature that I know you're going to love! So stay tuned for that. As for plants I don't know when I'll add more. 

More on this one in the future, but I've talked enough. Enjoy the video and let me know what you think down in the comment!

275		j9J0JsVDcDs	Exotic Orchids & The Nano Riparium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"We're back with new plants, a few updates and some maintenance! In this one we'll take a look at the Blue Dream Shrimp tank, the blackwater betta tank, the 180 gallon vivarium and the nano riparium. 

The shrimp tank is looking really good and I think the black sand elevates the aesthetic! Initially I was really feeling the light sand, but as time went on, I liked it less and less. I definitely think swapping it out was the right call. What do you think? Also, don't be afraid to make adjustments to your setups as time goes on. More often than not, you won't end up with a complete setup from the start. I always mine as time goes on to better suit my vision. 

The 180 gallon plywood vivarium is really starting to fill in and is close to how I envisioned it would look. There are just a few more things I need to add, but for now we'll add some orchids and other plants. The orchids are a great accent plant and they will bloom from time to time. If you can get your hands on some, I definitely recommend incorporating them in your builds. In this video I added some Dracula lotax, Masdevallia nidifica, Masdevallia bucculenta and a Macodes petola. All of these are well suited for this environment, but as I said in the video, the kind that you will typically see at the store (phalaenopsis) will not work in a setup like this.

Also I'm sure you're probably wondering where I got these plants. Other than the ones from my propagation bins, these all came from https://www.glassboxtropicals.com/ No I'm not affiliated in any way and I had to pay for all of these plants. 

Stainless Steel Wire: https://amzn.to/2MztwdU

You may have heard me mention that most of the new plants are epiphytes. Just in case you don't know, an Epiphyte is a plant that grows onto surfaces (usually tress) and uses the air to obtain its moisture and nutrients instead of a substrate, like most other plants. 

I'm really enjoying the blackwater betta tank as well, but I think Casper likes it more than I do. I bought him because of his bold personality, which is amplified with the addition of the rooibos tannins. This tea is great for drinking and as you saw it makes the tank look like a proper blackwater setup. If blackwater is something you're interested in trying, I highly recommend using some rooibos. It doesn't last very long, so if you don't like it, you can get rid of it quite easily. Anyways, check out the links below if you want to know more about this. Also, it should go without saying that you want 100% pure rooibos tea, nothing additional should be in the blend.

Info on Rooibos for Blackwater: https://youtu.be/2mctNahlj6E

Lastly the nano riparium is doing pretty well! I didn't stock it with any of the springtails or snails, they showed up on their own (most likely as hitchhikers). For those of you wondering, I do 100% weekly water changes on this setup to ensure the health of the system. Otherwise it requires very little maintenance. Also given the volume of water (0.2 gallons) it has been really easy to maintain thus far.

In fact, it's growing like a weed and needs some maintenance. So why don't we do a proper update and get this terrarium looking like a million bucks. 

As I usually say, if you want to keep up with the aesthetic that you envisioned for you terrarium, then do some maintenance. I know that not everyone likes the idea of it, but in my opinion it's a must. There's no way you can keep a terrarium looking this good without it. That said, it's possible to have a successful terrarium without doing anything.

277		fV5MucIp1M8	The American Bullfrog Paludarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"The American Bullfrog Paludarium is finally complete! I've been talking about this setup for awhile now and it took a few months to complete, but the wait was totally worth it. It could have been completed much sooner, but it took me a while to get all of the perfect materials. It was worth the wait though! Spending a little extra time to do things right the first time is always worth it. 

Like I said in the video, my goal was to loosely mimic the look of a pond's shore and I think I did that well. Obviously there's no soil, but the idea is for MJ to constantly look toward the water because he feels secure from behind. In the wild, this is exactly what pond frogs do, so shouldn't they do that in captivity as well. Take a look next time you're out frogging and you'll see what I'm saying. 

Most of you know that I used to keep MJ in bare bottom tanks for sanitary reasons, but this looks a million times better! There's no comparison at all. Due to the size of this tank, the filtration and the plants, I don't think I will have any issues keeping this tank clean. I will also add a clean up crew shortly. 

Also the water is not at all dirty. There are just tannins from the driftwood and some cloudiness from the Flourite. That should all clear up over time through water changes. 

Anyways, that's about everything additional that I wanted to add. Enjoy the build and if you have any comments, suggestions or questions, leave them down in the comments!

I've been letting this tank cycle and I had to move it to a new location, so I took my time with all of this. That's one of the things I always advocate too, take your time! There's no rush for any of this and generally things will turn out better if you take your time. Anyways after about three months I'm so glad to finally have these shrimp in their new home. 

As for the White Cloud Mountain Minnows in the Fire-Bellied Toad paludarium, they are doing quite well. Like I said in the video, this practice should be done at your own discretion, so I can't advocate it per say. However, under the right conditions it can work and I know a lot of others have had success with this as well. Just don't say I didn't tell you so if you try it and things don't work out for you. Regardless I'm glad that I gave it a try and really hope it works out long-term. They add a whole new dynamic to the setup that is really enjoyable. 

Stay tuned for updates on both of these and some upcoming project that I mentioned in the video! 

I know a lot of you are going to want to see what light I was talking about in the video. This is just a cheap LED shop light. If you're on a tight budget or just want something inexpensive, this appears to be a descent solution. They've been working pretty well for me, especially considering the price.

As such I figured now was a good time to do a commentary vlog and briefly update you on the animal room. I also wanted to thank you for an awesome 2018! There are so many things I could say, but I think the video does a good job of explaining where I'm at. In short, I thank each and every one of you for your support.

To show my thanks I put back into the content and do my best to make things that you can directly benefit from. If at any point you thought that this was all for views or money, understand that I could obtain those much easier with a different type of content. 

Anyways, like I said in the video, there's a lot to come moving forward in 2019. I'm not sure when these projects and ideas that I have in mind will come to fruition, but I have some really great stuff on the horizon. I've been saying for years that we're just getting started and that's even more true nowadays. I've been meticulously working toward my end goal (which we'll discuss at a later date) and tweaking when necessary, to better suit my vision.

To avoid rambling and saying the same thing over, I'll end it there. Again, thank you so much for sticking with me and for supporting what I do. I promise that you will not be disappointed moving forward. Have a happy, healthy and prosperous 2019 my friends. Enjoy the video :)

280		t-ImWSLwnso	The Native Terrarium 2 YEARS Later	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"""How's this terrarium doing today? When are we going to see the native terrarium again?!"" I know I slack on the updates... To be honest after the first update I usually don't feel like filming/editing another one and as a result they kind of fall by the wayside. That's for a number of reasons, but largely that I like to focus while doing maintenance and don't really care to film it. That said, I will continue to sporadically film them whenever I feel like it. 

Anyways, two years (or one year) later this terrarium is still going strong. Overall it's a fairly simple design, but I think it's effective and looks quite natural. Generally speaking that's my goal with terrariums anyways. I like to showcase a slice of nature and as I'm eluding to, in my opinion this terrarium does exactly that.

The terrarium ""purists"" will attack me because I opened a closed terrarium, but as I've said it's very beneficial and just makes sense. For me this is an art form and as and art form I will unapologetically show it that way. Anyways, if you want to see more videos involving this terrarium, check out the links below.

281		fbY48MFmwQE	Making a Blackwater Betta Aquarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I've been talking about it for awhile now and here it is, my betta's new blackwater aquarium! Like I said in the video, at this current time the water is hardly tinted at all. So you could argue that it's not even a blackwater setup, but it does use all of the elements of a typical blackwater setup. That said, I will definitely tint the water more as time goes on. 

With this one I really wanted to make something that I knew the betta would like and benefit from. That's largely why I added the botanicals in the first place. They not only look cool and natural, but are really beneficial, especially to bettas. Bettas have delicate fins and if damaged can be easily infected. Leaf litter and other natural goodies will actually help combat this and most likely make it a non-issue. I honestly would like to see this become the standard with bettas because I know I've had issues with it in the past. 

I also think that people are finally warming up to tannins, which is great. I was very much a part of the camp who thought tannins made your tank look dirty and undesirable. I used to waste so much money on carbon and do relentless water changes just to remove them. I also used to dislike the aesthetic of leaf litter in vivariums. My perspective on both has changed though and I think that fishkeepers at large are really starting to warm up to them, which is great to see.

Anyways, hopefully you enjoy this setup as much as betta does!

I'm sure you could consider it many other things, but I felt that “riparium” best describes what this is. For those of you who remember, I build the aquarium back in March. I tried to do a different riparium before this one, but I just wasn't feeling it, so the tank has just been sitting off to the side. With this one I wanted to go for a sort of bog/marsh look, alongside other riparian elements. 

Believe it or not a lot of plants will work in this type of setting. Just look for things that like soggy/wet soil or grow in or near bodies of water in nature (i.e. marginal plants). Most aquarium plants will also do really well in a setup like this, but you will most likely have to gradually acclimate them to the open air. If you want to learn more about this topic then stay tuned. I'm working on a fairly in-depth video about it. 

Anyways, enjoy this little side project and let me know what you think! For additional content like this, photos of my terrariums and animals, projects sneak peeks and more, follow me on Instagram @SerpaDesign. https://www.instagram.com/serpadesign.

283		1JN88ISkhzI	Terrarium in an Aquarium - What Should I Do?	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Many of you have been asking me to do an update on the Terrarium in an Aquarium and here it is! We're actually just around the six month mark, so it's an appropriate time to do the update. As you'll see in the video the terrarium didn't last. This was an experimental build, so I'm not too distraught about it, but I would have liked to see thrive.

I don't really want to go through the trouble of remaking it, but I suppose that I will consider based on your thoughts. There are about four possible solutions moving forward:
1. Redo the terrarium and keep up with it.
2. Remove the contents of the terrarium, bring the aquarium into the jar and leave the lid open.
3. Turn the jar into a ecosphere or sealed aquarium.
4. Remove the jar altogether and tweak the aquarium.*

* I personally like this option the best because of how well the aquarium is doing. I could always give this another try in a different type of enclosure. 

There are a couple of reasons why this didn't work, but most notably it was lack of maintenance as I said in the video. It's one thing if this were my only aquarium, but I have 5 (and counting) on top of all my other setups. So to dedicate more time than is necessary on maintenance is tough to do. Of course there was also the fact that I built this just before the move period, which took about 5 months. It was really tough to keep up with my setup, so all I did was minimal maintenance. Some time is freed up now, but as I expand and do more, I have to find better ways to allocate/prioritize my time. Anyways let me know what you think I should do and if you have any ideas for future projects let me know!

Also the plants came from glasshouseworks.com (I'm not sponsored and I payed for the plants)

284		Sc9lv1DQZb8	AWESOME Zebra Stone Aquascape	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"A lot of you have been wanting aquascapes... so here's one! This is a scape that I've been talking about for the past two videos, so I'm excited to finally release it! I think it turned out really well, but like I usually say, “It's gotta grow in a lot” so give it time! I know we want them to look a certain way immediately, but it takes time and patience before these things fill and look proper. That said, I will add some more plants and other elements later on, but nothing major. 

I know you may be wondering, “when will you stock it.” I will most likely do that in a few weeks, but it really all depends on how long it takes for the aquarium to establish. Like I said we will for sure add the blue dream shrimp, but I suppose that we could add other inhabitants down the road. Part of me wants it to be a dedicated shrimp tank, but I'm open to the idea. Let me know down in the comments what you think I should do! 

Lastly you may be wondering about lighting. I'm just using an LED shop light for this aquarium. That said, I used a different light in the footage (which isn't as bright) because I was getting LED flickers. I tried a few methods to get rid of them without luck. If anyone knows how I can get rid of them please let me know! 

Here's a complete list of plants used in this build:
Bolbitis heudelotii
Cryptocoryne hudoroi
Cryptocoryne wentii ('Green' & 'Bronze')
Fissidens (Fox, geppi and nobilis)
Ludwigia repens 'Rubin'
Red Tiger Lotus
Rotala wallichi
Süßwassertang

In case you're wondering I got most of these from my LFS. However, if you use code “BobMoss” on H2OPlants.com you can get 10% off your first order. Also, check out Mossy Jake on Instagram! He posts pics of some really awesome aquarium plants: https://www.instagram.com/mossy_jake/

285		pNiqKl36lA8	I Got RUBBER DUCKY Isopods!	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Rubber Ducky Isopods?! Yes that correctly, I seriously just got some isopods (pill bugs, rollie pollies, wood louse, wood lice, etc) that look like rubber duckies. These were newly discovered last year in Thailand, so they're still pretty new to the hobby. You may think that they're overrated or that they're not worth it, but let me tell you, these are incredible! I have been trying to get them since that time and I didn't know what to expect, but I was honestly astounded when I saw them in person.

A special thanks to my man ReptileNerd, who reached out to me and directed me to the site that I bought them from. If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't have found them! Full disclosure, I paid for these and this not a sponsored video. Anyways my isopods came in great and super quick at that! So if your looking for isopods, I definitely recommend that you check this site out: https://www.isopod.com/product-page/cubaris-sp-rubber-ducky

I know that a lot of you have been wanting to see some content with isopods for awhile, so hopefully this holds you down for a bit. I will of course make care videos and everything like that when I have the time, but it's not on my immediate radar. If there's any other content that you would like to see regarding isopods, definitely let me know. 

In regard to content, let's circle back to some questions that I had in the video:

1. What should I stock the stock pond with long-term? As I said, I'm thinking something small, colorful and active. It doesn't have to be that, but for some reason that's all I can picture at this time, especially once I get more emerged plant growth.
2. What would you like to see me discuss in the aquascape videos? I already know how I want the scapes to look. However, I wasn't sure if there was something specific you'd like me to detail. Let me know if there is! 

Also you probably couldn't tell from the video, but those blue dream shrimp for Lucas Bretz are seriously beautiful (and BLUE)! Lucas is a fellow hobbyist, who has over 200 tanks and breeds/sells aquarium livestock, plants, etc. If you're not following him, I definitely recommend that you do. He's a serious gem in the aquarium hobby! Tell I sent you, if you feel inclined to do so.

286		Lf8Y3XFTDCI	Expanding the Animal Room... Again!	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Ah yes... the animal room, my forever work in progress. Although I've always known what I want it to be, it's just one of those things where my vision constantly changes. I'm always adjusting and building things, which makes me wonder if it will ever be complete. Likely not, but I suppose that's one of the things that makes it fun! Originally I had no intent on doing a lot of the things seen in this video, but as I said, my vision changes. That was largely because I couldn't put the rack in it's original location and the issue with my goldfish.  

I also think this is a good example of what you can do with a small amount of space. This is just a tiny chunk of my entire room, but there's a lot going on. So  if your trying to keep animals and such, you really don’t need a lot of room to have a nice setup. Just think it through and make sure that you can can still easily do maintenance. Also, as I said in the video, modular racks like this one are a great long-term option (especially if you're just starting out), since you can always adjust them down the road.

Now I have a few questions for you:

1. What should I do with the stock pond long-term? As I said in the video I have some cool plan for it now, but I'm open to suggestions and stocking options.

2. What do you want to see me do with the 10 gallon aquariums? Like everything else, I have a plan in mind already for the one. I am open to suggestions with the other though.

287		mC4earMBHIo	The Venus Fly Trap Terrarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"It's time for another experiment, the Venus Fly Trap Terrarium! A lot of you have been asking me to do a carnivorous plant terrarium for some time and here's one of them. As I expressed in the video, the likelihood for success here really isn't all that high given the nature of these plants. However, I do think that if I play my cards right I can get this to work. 

Venus Fly Traps require very specific care requirements. I tried to cover the basics the best I could in this video, but if this is something that interests you, I highly recommend doing your research ahead of time (as you should with anything). I really didn't cover all that much, just enough to explain what I was doing. Also, I'm not an expert with these types of plants, but I tried my best to make a terrarium that I felt could sustain these plants.

Lastly, as I said in the video, I will document the whole process (on video) and release a follow up video in early-mid spring. If we can this thing going long-term, I will follow up with a more in-depth video. I will also do a less experimental, tropical carnivorous plant terrarium at some point in the future.

If you are completely new to terrariums then I recommend checking out the lineup of videos I have linked below. It may seem daunting at first and you may initially fail, but if you keep at it, terrariums are pretty simple and really fun! That said, understanding the fundamentals is key and these videos will help you with that. From there, you should be able to take your skills and make something amazing!

288		PVRlXXhdD7U	The ULTIMATE Fire-Bellied Toad Paludarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"You have been asking and asking for years now... and it's finally here! Hopefully this build exceeds your expectations because I think it turned out really well. Although this is the first paludarium on the channel it will not be the last. Paludariums are awesome because they combine two of my favorite hobbies (aquariums and terrariums). The possibilities are endless, but this one is intended to highlight my Fire-Bellied Toads. 

As I expressed in the video, choosing plants can be easier than you probably think. The majority of plants sold as ""aquarium plants"" will actually grow quite well in an emerged (out of water), humid environment. In fact this is how they are usually grown before you get them, which is why they have to acclimate to your aquarium. As a result, most aquarium plants are a great choice for this type of setup. Terrestrial plants that grow in soggy soil or near wetlands in nature also work just as well. Do a little research on the plants and I'm sure you can find a batch that suit your taste/intended purpose. 

As I kept saying in the video, take your time! There are a ton of variables at play with a setup like this, so it's very important to make sure that your setup is not a logistical nightmare. Although fairly basic, I hope this paludarium gives you an idea of what's possible. Good luck! 

Check out the complete plant list below:
Anubias barteri
Anubias 'Golden Coin'
Anubias lancifolia
Anubias nana 'Petite' 
Cryptanthus nubicola
Cryptanthus 'Red Star'
Ficus pumila 'Quecifolia'
Fittonia 'Red Vein'
Java Fern

Kangaroo Fern
Peperomia 'Ruby Cascade'
Pilea involucrata
Purple Waffle Plant

Today we'll set up a naturalistic vivarium for my brother's Tri-Color Burrowing Scorpion. She's a beautiful animal and needed an enclosure to match and that's why I'm here.

If you are looking for a scorpion that's always going to be visible than this isn't the one for you. It will spend most of its time in its borrows. That said, it will come out to feed and soak in the water dish from time to time. Also, like I said, this is not a care guide. If this is an animal you want to keep, go and do your research! They're not difficult at all, but you want to make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. These scorpions tend to be quite defensive/aggressive. I don't personally keep scorpions, but my bet for a beginner would be an Emperor Scorpion (that's what my bro started with). They're pretty timid and much more receptive to handling. 

Anyways, maybe I'll keep some ""bugs"" of my own some day and do more setups like this. Also, my brother is trying to get more critters like this, so I'm sure he'll let me make more enclosure for him. If this is something you'd like to see again let me know down in the comments and I can definitely do so!

I guess I was a month late though though... for some reason I thought that I built this one in September and never bothered to verify. Anyways, this terrarium is doing great and I'm so glad to finally share the two year update with you! 

In case you're new to my channel, How to Terrarium was a series that I did a few years back. The purpose of it was to show various types of terrarium builds from start to end, so that you could learn to do the same. Eventually I will remake and continue that series because I think I could do it much better nowadays. Regardless, if you are new to terrariums that series is a great place to start. Also, if you are curious to know how I built this terrarium in the first place, then I recommend watching that video.

292		kIztk-628Vc	Moving My 150 Gallon Cube Aquarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Yes! I finally got a chance to move one of my favorite aquariums! This might not be the best scaped aquarium, the most uniquely stocked or the biggest one around, but it's just so fun! I thoroughly enjoy the high energy and great feeding response of the inhabitants and I also think that the dimensions (36x36x27"") play a huge role in why I like this tank.

Long-term I may turn this setup into a planted aquarium, but for the time being I'm enjoying it just the way it is. That said, I do want to get a few more inhabitants at some point soon (leave some suggestions in the comments). I built this system to handle a lot of fish and trust me, it can handle a few more. 

This was by far the most stressful tank to move and the one that I was most concerned about, but it ended up being a very successful endeavor. There were no casualties, the sump filter is still running like a champ and it's even better than before. 

Anyways, enjoy the video and thanks for watching! BTW I still have to finalize the series on this build. The entire system is DIY, so if you want to know more about this setup I will likely cover it in another video. Oh yeah, here's a link to how I built the sump. ;)

It's one thing if it's from old age, but it's always tougher when it's your fault (which it usually is) or if you don't know what happened. You can do everything “right” and follow the steps that you have found for successes, but something can always go wrong. 

Like I said in the video, I've had this happen before and it gradually made me get out of fish keeping. The cause was much different (largely out of my hands), but the fish were much older, so it was tough. However, getting out of the hobby back then was a total mistake. Regardless, everything ran it's course and here I am today, nearly 8 years later in a similar scenario. 

It's especially tough because I always raise my animals up from babies. I can't think of a time that I've ever bought them as adults. So in a way they become my children and dealing with loss is never easy. Luckily it's pretty rare in the big scheme, but no matter the scenario, it never gets any easier. That said, the joy that I get from my animals trumps the sadness of loss. Very few things give me a smile quite like my buddies. I know a lot of people don't get it, but I can't get enough of them. I suppose it's also tough because you can't replace your animals. Although you can get the “same” fish again, it's never actually the same. All of these animals have their own personalities (just like people) and although two can be similar, they will never be the same. 

Anyways, I didn't make this video for you to feel sorry for me or to make myself look bad, but I put it out there to let you know that it's alright. It happens to everyone! It's alright to feel sad and depressed for while and in fact is totally normal. IMO if you don't feel those types of feelings, I'm not sure you should be keeping animals at all. Even the most experienced people make mistakes or have some freak event that causes a disaster. Look across YouTube and you will see other hobbyists that have had their fair share of misfortune. Just remember why you keep animals in the first place, learn from your mistakes and gain character from loss.

As you can see from the terrarium it's doing quite well. All of the moss is growing in and overall the aesthetic is just getting stronger. I was very particular about the hardscape with this one and I think that's one of the elements that really helps this terrarium shine. Regardless, I can't wait to see how it does now that we've done some maintenance. In most cases a little bit of trimming stimulates a lot of new growth and helps things grow in denser. We'll see what happens though!

I've been wanting to make this one for awhile now and I decided the other day that it was finally time to make it happen. My goal with this one was to show you that even if you're limited to working on a small scale, you can still make a pretty cool terrarium. Of course I already showed you the Tiny Native Terrariums, but as I've said on many occasion, those are sort of a gimmick. Although they do work, they're not practical. This one on the other hand is small enough that it's appealing, but large enough that it's still practical. Not to mention that something like this can be made for very little money given the size of the jar. 

When all was said and done I think this terrarium turned out pretty well, but it's not as detailed as I would have liked it to be. In all honestly I didn't take a ton of time being a perfectionist because of my current situation, so maybe we'll revisit this project or make something similar in the future. That said, I do think this terrarium is detailed enough to warrant the title and I like... I usually like all of my terrarium though. :)

298		TJlrvs3tPNU	My NEW House & The FUTURE	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"So here's what all the fuss is about! We finally closed on our new home and have been diligently working to get it all fixed up and ready to live in. There's still a lot to be done, but it's really starting to shape up and in this video, I show you all of the pertinent details. I should also say that I wanted to show more of the process itself, but it was tough to film, while trying to do things efficiently and with our families around (not everyone wants to be on camera). 

Anyways, moving is somewhat stressful, but it's mostly time consuming. So I haven't had much of a chance to finish up making some tutorials that I have in the works and/or put out the content that I know you want to see. As I mentioned in the video I'm working on a few paludariums, a pond and even some fish tank updates among other things. I also know that you want to see how I move my animals and terrariums, so expect that very soon. Next week's video will most likely be about moving the animals or the terrarium shelves. So we won't return to my “normal” content for at least a few weeks. 

Believe it or not, the hardest part about the process is being separate from my animals and everything else (aka my sanctuary). It's also tough not working on projects. It's programmed in my being that I need to make stuff. So although updating the house fits that category, it's not quite the same (yet). Lastly with all of that in mind, I want to apologize for being vacant in the comments. I just haven't had a time to catch up yet. I'll probably go through and answer them all this evening or tomorrow morning.

This terrarium is growing out of control and needs some serious maintenance, so let's do exactly that. If you want to check out the original build video or other updates on this terrarium, follow the links below:

Original Build: https://youtu.be/kpfZfyUBQi0
6 Month Update: https://youtu.be/lRuFEBmHpcM?t=1m31s

A lot of people dislike the fact that I do maintenance on my terrariums and this one is no exception. Which brings up the question, is it necessary to do maintenance on a terrarium? The short answer is no. Once a terrarium is sealed up, it should not need additional water or maintenance. 

However, there is more to it than that. Think about the logistics of a terrarium. Plants don't stop growing, so when you put them in a closed container, you better believe that they will outgrow their space at some point. So, if you want to prologue the aesthetic of your terrarium, maintenance it is a must. Terrariums will also function better if maintained. Trimming old plant growth helps stimulate new growth among other benefits.

300		cSOqzl31q0c	My Last Animal Room Tour & Update (Summer 2018)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"So the end of an era is finally here. This is something that I've been going on about since my first animal room tour and I'm happy to say that it's finally coming to fruition. That's why this will be the last updated tour of my current animal room! It's sad that I will be taking it all apart to move elsewhere, but it's all for the best. I'm very limited on dedicated spaces right now, but that's something that will change in the future. What I mean is that my animal room is where I do everything (it's my workshop, storage area, etc, etc). As a result it's very difficult to consistently and efficiently make content in my current situation. However, I like the grind, so don't take any of that as a complaint from me. I'm very grateful for what I have and I'm sure the other patch of grass will have its fair share of rough spots. 

It's also kind of ironic that most of my animals will be getting new homes as well! Like I said, we've got the pond coming up, three paludariums, fish tank remodels, etc. The list of content just keeps growing and I'm very excited for what I have in store for you all. So when I move in a few weeks, be sure to let me know what you want to see from that process. Also don't forget about the dart frogs! What should I get? Anyways, I have some cool stuff planned, so stay tuned!

Enough on that though! I've mentioned this in all of my other tours, but I didn't explicitly say it in this video. If you want to keep exotic animals, be sure to put the animals first. I KNOW that once you get the bug, it's very easy to collect over your means. I did it in the past (before YouTube), so I know my limits. Trust me it's NOT a good situation to be in. Remember though that everyone's situation is different. Just because someone has a ton of animals does not mean they're providing sub par care or vise versa. Although my current collection is far from small, it's easy for me to maintain. Also I've been at this for about 18 years, so I've been around the block. What I'm saying is DON'T get so many animals that you're struggling to take care of them. Honestly, less is more. In fact, I'm somewhat envious of anyone who keeps a small or single animal collection. That being said, I only know how to do things one way and that's in excess. :D

The last thing that I want to say is that if you can house your animals without continuously upgrading, then please do that. It's somewhat hypocritical of me to say because my hobby was built on upgrading my animals over time. However, you will save time, money, hassle and your animals will stress less. Plus sometimes you may end up keeping an animal in a smaller enclosure much longer than they probably should be (i.e. my goldfish or MJ). Anyways, I'm getting off the soapbox! Enjoy the video and I'll talk to you all soon!

301		qimC5jSJIqI	Let's Make a Terrarium in the Wilderness	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"It's the peak of summer and the weather has been beautiful. That means there's no better time to go outside in the wilderness and make a terrarium, than right now! One of the things I always say about terrariums is that they can help you reconnect with and appreciate nature. After all, one of the main reasons that I make terrariums is that I can't get enough of nature. So I decided that I wanted to take you all out in back yard, relax and make a terrarium. 

I've been having a pretty stressful time as of late, so making this video was a way for me to blow off some steam. I'll talk more about that in a few weeks, but big changes are coming to my life and this channel, so stay tuned! I mentioned in the video that there's really “no point to making terrariums.” What I meant is that in the grand scheme they don't account for much. However, I don't think that terrariums are pointless. They are beautiful, enjoyable, fun and great for learning! Many of you have told me that terrariums have been such a positive element in your life and that alone is proof that they're not pointless. 

Finally, when making terrariums I try to keep things simple and natural. So making a terrarium out in the woods is a great way to gain inspiration. You also will have an unlimited supply of hardcape materials and likely a good selection of plants as well. I highly recommend giving it a try some time because I really enjoyed! Sit back, relax, enjoy the sounds and sights of nature and let's make a terrarium!

302		zXCpJdfoPxU	Make a Lamp Terrarium (Lamparium)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Let's make a Lamp Terrarium or a Lamparium! Most terrariums are simply nice to look at, but this one is also quite functional. So if you thought that it was a waste of resources/time to make a terrarium, then maybe this is the one for you. Chances are that you need a lamp, so why not make it a Lamp Terrarium?

These are really quite simple to make and not much different than a standard terrarium, other than a few components. You could easily combine these techniques with a lot of the terrarium builds I've shown on the channel. Just in case you are new to the channel, I will link you up to some useful terrarium videos to help you get started.

Here's a video about rewiring a lamp. It cover more than is probably necessary for this build, but it never hurts to have more knowledge. Also, I'm not affiliated with this channel in any way, but it was the clearest demonstration I could find on the procedure. 

Rewire a Lamp: https://youtu.be/1d720r9Er-0

If you're thinking that this is an expensive project, it's really not. The Jar Light kits can get a little pricey, but the Build Your Own Lamp kits are quite inexpensive. Also this could potentially be done for little, to no expense. If you are able to find an old lamp in the trash or at a thrift store, you could dismantle it to obtain the light socket and other pertinent components and toss the rest. As promised I linked up the most inexpensive options I could find down below (not exactly the same as what I've used and not sponsored links).

303		KTSL83wG3AY	My Crested Geckos Are FINALLY HOME	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"My Crested Geckos (Henry and Delilah) are finally in their new homes! I built their vivariums back in March, which doesn't seem like that long ago, but it really is. I know it can be tempting to stock your enclosures immediately, but it always pays off to wait. Whether that be a bioactive vivarium or an aquarium, waiting is ALWAYS the right thing to do! In this case, I mainly wanted the plants to grow and become established. That can only happen with time/patience. Of course I also wanted the clean up to crew to become established, but more can always be added, so they're not as important in this equation. 

If you want to see the original build videos for all of this and learn how to do it for yourself, check out the links below: 
DIY Plywood Enclosure https://youtu.be/lbbhz2XtX34
Henry Vivarium Build https://youtu.be/aSGq-9kbaxM
Delilah Vivarium Build https://youtu.be/5qkq9XQXac0

This video was not intended to be a full blown update on everything or a care video, so I covered very little about what goes into these vivariums. However, they are very easy to care for and the geckos seems to like them. They're live planted, bioactive (contain springtails and isopods) and 100% DIY. The enclosures measure 24x24x32”, which equates to roughly 80 gallons, but only 60 gallons of that space is usable. I keep the temperature at 81°F in the day and 76°F at night. The humidity also varies depending on when I spray the enclosures, but it fluctuates between 60-75%. I also use a 26w Exo Terra Tropical UVB bulb and a standard LED bulb from. UVB is generally not seen as a requirement when it comes to Crested Geckos, but I highly recommend it. 

Also, as I expressed in the video, I think its very important to provide a lot of cover for your gecko. If you want a happy and content animal, I believe that it's an absolutes necessity. Keep in mind that the personality of the gecko will play a part in all of this, but you shouldn't bank on ending up with a gecko that feels secure with minimal coverage (some are skittish and some aren't). That said, you may get discouraged if your animal hides and you can't see them. Not to come across the wrong way, but if that's why you're keeping a gecko in the first place, then you have the wrong pet. What I mean is that you shouldn't force behavior at the expense of the animal. Provide a natural environment and receive natural behaviors or vise versa. 

Anyways I figured I'd give you a little insight on these enclosures, but we'll do a proper update and in-depth look at some point in the future. Enjoy!

As I say at the end of the video, terrariums are so fun and that's why I put so much into this content.

Anyways, a ton of you commented on the Terrarium in an Aquarium video that you wanted to see me put a terrarium in a terrarium and so on. There were other, similar suggestions, but this was the only one that I felt like doing right now. 

I kept it fairly simple overall, so that the focus stayed on the smaller terrariums and the inhabitants. On that I expect some comments on who I put in the terrarium. Isopods and Springtails are pretty standard, so there's not much to say about them. Millipedes are a great addition, that I've simply not really shown before. Snails on the other hand are a bit of an experiment, along with the uninvited ants. We'll see if either cause any issues, but I think it should be fine. ALSO, if you intend on adding these inhabitants into your terrariums, expect them to eat your plants! That's just what they do. My advice is to use a lot of moss and/or add some leaf litter to keep them preoccupied.

- Information on Sealing the Jar - 
In this demonstration, I used a jar that already comes with a gasket and it worked great. However, what if you can't get a hold of this jar or want to use something else? Well if your using a container that is sealed with a cork, you can simply use a “Rubber Stopper.” If you already have container with a lid and it's not leak proof, then you can use the DIY rubber gasket, shown in the video. If none of those options interest you, then you could also make a DIY Oogoo cap. If done properly, I have no doubt that it would work. More information on each item in the links below.

I also recommend that you only use a glass jar. Silicone doesn't readily adhere to plastic, but it sure does work for glass! On that, any sort of 100% silicone (I usually use GE Silicone I) will work fine for this application. Also, you'll do best to stick with a plastic lid, if you're using something ready-made. Metal lids or anything that will contaminate the water column are not advised. 


-Plants-
Below is a complete list of the plants used in this video. I know that many of you will ask where I get my plants. Most of the plants used in the terrarium were sourced locally. The aquarium plants on the other hand were purchased at a few local fish stores and given to yours truly by Justin at H2O Plants. I met up with Justin a few months back to build a terrarium. In return he gave me some of the awesome plants in this video, such as the Hygrophila polysperma 'Sunset' (which you most likely won't be able to obtain in the US, given the nature of this plant). Anyways check out the link below to see what plants he has (this isn't a sponsored video and he didn't ask me to plug this). https://www.h2oplants.com/

- What Happened to my Fish? - 
So I'll keep this brief, but basically here's what happened with my fish. A few months back when it started getting warmer I had to go on a business trip. Before doing so, I did the usual maintenance on all of my aquariums, but something was off with the ones that require warm water. That said, I also have two cold water setups, which weren't affected by this issue. Anyways, I noticed that water was coming out of tap with a lot of white particles in it or that's what it looked like at least. Unfortunately I couldn't find my test kit and I didn't have time to get one because I was leaving the day after. 

I was concerned for my fish, but I let the aquariums alone and hoped that the water just needed to clear up. The next day, which was the day I left, the aquariums looked perfectly clear. So I left for my trip, with some peace of mind. However, upon my return I was greeted by a betta and knife fish that had passed. Those were really the only two sensitive fish that I had and unfortunately they are now lost. It's sad, but it's a reality that comes with these hobbies. 

When I returned, I did maintenance again and nothing was wrong with the water this time. So once I got a chance to finally test it, nothing seemed out of the ordinary and I haven't had issues since. I trust my brother did take of the animals well, so I strongly believe that this was due to the water. I don't know if the township did something different with the water because of the weather change or if there was something up with my water heater, etc. If you've had this issue before, leave a comment about it below. I've never seen something like it before in the 11 years I've kept fish and they were seemingly healthy the days before my departure."	12m 8s	728	2018-06-09T13:39:34Z			2,772,667	49,014			2,608	Playlist: Uploads from SerpaDesign (added 2018-06-09)		true	true	2d	hd	false	rectangular	youtube	public								7	terrarium, terrariums, aquarium, terrarium in an aquarium, aquascape, nature terrarium, terraquarium	0	
307		ISy54oWgLIE	My 180 Gallon Vivarium is Taking Shape	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Let's set up the all new 180 gallon vivarium! I believe that I said previously it was 190 gallons... not sure where that came from, but it's definitely 180. If you remember I just recently took down my old 125 gallon vivarium and this is its replacement. I think that it turned out great, but it's an unfinished canvas. There's still so much work to be done. Regardless, I wanted to share my progress thus far.

Since I've explained most of the things I've done in this video before, I wanted to take a different approach for this demonstration. I thought that it might be helpful to give more insight on how I make aesthetic decisions (placing plants, hardscape, etc). I didn't want to bore you, so I did my best to keep it at a minimum... I know, I can get quite “ranty” about it! 

I also want to circle back to something I talked about in the video, that I may not have elaborated on well enough. Originally I had two lights in the enclosure, an LED shop light and a CFL heat lamp. I accidentally left both lights on for the first day and I quickly realized that the plants were getting cooked! So any acclimation issues with the plants happened in less than 24 hours! Everything has been fine since then, but unfortunately I lost a few plants and others took a beating (ficus pumila and anubias). However, they are already showing off a lot of new growth. I'm sure the change in humidity (70% to 95%+) took its tool as well.

Anyways, after I removed the light and added some more ventilation holes (I will show those in a different video), everything has been great. I was pretty bummed about all of this, but I try not to have unreal expectations about my work. Stuff happens, you just gotta take it and find a solution. Also, in case you're wondering, I'm keeping this setup at a consistent temp of 76° F and a humidity of 95%+. I will talk more about that and how this vivarium works in the follow up video.  

Let me know down in the comments what you think about this setup thus far. Do you like it better than the old or did you like the 125 better? I suspect that many of you will miss the 125, but give this one some time. That setup didn't get that strong overnight!

Although the terrarium itself is somewhat a gimmick, there's no gimmick behind the fact that this terrarium is actually suspended in mid air. No strings, no tricks, just magnets. 

As I said in the video, I have to give credit to Matthew for this idea. He showed off his terrarium in the November 2017 Terrarium Contest, using this technique. I thought the idea was so cool, that I had to make one for myself. Thanks again for the inspiration Matt! 

I do like this terrarium, but there's one thing that I don't care for. You'll notice that the power cord is on the left side of the platform. Unfortunately, the viewing side of the terrarium defaults to this location, so there was no way around it.

309		df61sY1RMw0	Dismantling the 125 Gallon Vivarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Today we finally take down the beloved 125 Gallon Vivarium, which has been going strong for about 8 years now. It's been in the background of most of my videos and is no doubt a part of this channel. However, it's finally time for it to go. I've been thinking about this for around a year now, so it's not a decision that I made lightly. 

I probably would have kept this setup going for much longer, but it has some issues. Most notably that the glass is etched with hard water stains. Unfortunately this makes it really difficult to view, film, photograph and inevitably enjoy. I really wanted to share this setup more with you and even view it more myself. As I showed in the video though, you have to spray down the front of the glass to be able to see and that only lasts for around 5-10 minutes. So opportunity arose with the 180 gallon plywood tank and I seized it. 

Short-term we are going to put Whodini,my Blotched Kingsnake, into this 125 gallon aquarium. If I am able to get the glass completely clean, which I doubt is possible, then he will stay long-term. Most likely this will replace one of my existing aquariums or serve as a plant grow out tank. Alternatively, I could replace the front pane of glass or even convert this into a vertical vivarium. I think both are viable options for sure. What do you think? Let me know down in the comments what I should do with this aquarium. Regardless, the tank itself isn't going anywhere! I'm going to have it for life! Glass will last forever, you just have to reseal and replace the silicone seams from time-to-time. 

Anyways, enjoy the video and don't be too sad about the conclusion of the 125 saga. No doubt I was and am still sad about it, but it's for the best. Although the 180 is giving me problems right now, it's going to be 1,000x better than the 125 was... trust me! Don't be afraid to take down your old work to replace with new work. You should always be improving and sometimes that means letting things go.

310		BxTIguvthWg	No Opening Terrarium Redo!	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"In this video we redo the No Opening Terrarium. Unfortunately it just didn't work out the first time because of the potting mix. However, I like it much better this time around, do you? That said, I have the utmost confidence that it will last long-term. Five days in and everything appears to be doing very well and it sure looks promising, but only time will tell! 

Like I've said countless times, I never want any of you to avoid making a terrarium because you're afraid to fail. Failure is a part of life and if you use it as learning experience, you will come out better the second time, every time. Not to say that you are guaranteed success the second time, but each time you will get closer to where you want to be.

311		92HIznjKxx8	The Future of My 125g Vivarium	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Hey everyone! In this vlog I finally tell you guys about what I'm going to do in a few days. This is not something that I planned for and it actually wasn't intended to be the focus of the video. Then about half way in... I started scheming some ideas and had to share! 

I know some of you won't like the fact that the 125g is being transferred, but its time has come and it's for the better. As I said, it's just not enjoyable for me and I would like to feature it more, but it's nearly impossible, in its current state. Also, I think that the 125g will be better suited for Whodini long term. 

Additionally, I've got big plans coming up for some of my other animals (the 40g rack). Now you know about the rack, but I won't tell you about what kind of setups I'm going to do. All that I will say is they they're going to be one-of-a-kind enclosures! Don't worry I will do a full blown tutorial for each one. 

As mentioned, here's a video that explains a little bit about how I built the stand earlier in the video. I made some modifications on my end to make it stronger, but you get the idea. It's basically three frames, fours posts, a few supporting boards and a lot of screws. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qXntuj5nbE 

At the time I didn't want to make a video on it because of time constraints. However, at some point I will need to make some more of these. If you guys would like to see me do a tutorial at that time, I most definitely can! Just comment about it below.

Anyways I think I've said enough! Wait maybe I should say one more thing... I do upload these vlogs occasionally, but I don't want any of you to think that I'm going to step down from making tutorials or that this is what my content will become. Tutorials are my BNB and I love making them. Just like my life, I keep it diverse. My content is no exception. I will keep it varied.

312		B15p1wyT0UA	Just a Few Terrarium Updates (Bottle, Jumbo and No Opening Terrariums)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Another Terrarium Update is here! A lot of you have been questioning me about all three of these terrariums and here they are. I put the updates off a bit because I didn't think there was enough to discuss about them individually. That said, today I show you whats going on with the:

No Opening Terrarium (7 Months, 16 Days; 228 Days total)
Jumbo Terrarium (11 Months, 2 Days; 337 Days total)
Bottle Terrarium (1 Year, 2 Months, 6 Days; 430 Days total)

As I said in the video, I think that the Bottle Terrarium and Jumbo Terrarium are doing very well. I'm pleased with their progress and I look forward to seeing what the future holds. 

However, the No Opening Terrarium unfortunately wasn't a success... this time that is! Experimentation is often paired with failure and that's what happened here. So my advice to you is don't use Miracle-Gro Organic Potting Soil in your terrarium. There are various 'questionable' things on the back that I'm sure caused the issue. Bad on me for not actually reading the contents and assuming it would be fine to use, but in some ways I'm glad that it didn't work out. I get another try at making a terrarium and learned something in the process. Regardless, stay tuned for the redo on that terrarium in the near future! 

With the above in mind, I should simply say that failure or the fear thereof, should not stop you from making terrariums or doing anything for that matter. Expect failure, embrace it and learn from it! 

Also, I apologize if the audio was off in this video. My microphone broke and I had to use a backup in the mean time. Unfortunately it picks more background noise than my lavalier.

When I went to Philadelphia the other week, I also took a road trip out to New Jersey, to tour H2O Plants and do a terrarium build live stream! If for whatever reason you missed the live stream and wanted to see it, I left a link down below:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5-NMpNXooE

Anyways, Justin at H2O Plants was kind enough to let me tour his facility. In the video it looks much bigger than it actually is, but I was surprised to see it in person. It probably doesn't help that I'm on the tall side as well! That said, I commend Justin on his practical use of space. I think he did an excellent job fitting all of what you see into his basement.

Unfortunately I was picking up a lot of background noise with my mic. Normally I would use a lavalier mic in a situation like this, but I needed to capture both of our voices. With that in mind, you may perceive that this room is really noisy. Although it does have more ambient background noise than my room, it's not nearly as bad as this video suggests. Also, I did my best to try and isolate our voices, but a little bit of noise is still present. Regardless, background noise is a reality that comes with fish tanks - you can only dampen the noise so much! 

I had a great time just talking about aquariums and plants... who wouldn't?! Justin and I have been talking online for months now and it was cool to actually meet him in person. He is officially now a member of my Plant Family... and the Terrarium Family! Also, this video really is only a portion of what we talked about. I had to trim more than half of the clips, so that this video was a 'viewer friendly' length. 

Even though this is a tour and I tried to let Justin do most of the talking, I did my best to fit in education when the opportunity arose. I've officially said enough... sit back and enjoy!

314		KR2Lo0rOF7g	Make an AWESOME Terrarium for FREE!	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Terrariums are great fun and I honestly think the world would be a better place if everyone would make one! I could list a number of reasons why I think this, but that's not the point of the video. 

I get a ton of comments and excuses from people as to why they can't make a terrarium. Some say that they don't want to kill any plants and others say that they don't have any money. My response generally is something like, “They don't cost much to make and are easy to maintain. You should create one.”  That said, I don't believe in making excuses for anything and in this video, I wanted to take down the myth that terrariums are expensive to construct. In fact, you could make one for $0 if you are still on the fence. 

It should go without saying that there are a number of ways to make an effective terrarium. The methods that I show in this video are simply adaptations of what I find to be extremely effective. So if you have not yet jumped into the world of terrariums, now is your time! Seriously, go outside and get it done already... you'll thank me later. 

On a side note, if you're not good with plants or live in a temperate area, I recommend starting out with moss, liverwort and selaginella (spike moss), if you can find it. Mosses are in most cases bullet proof and work extremely well in terrariums. Also a lot of temperate plants just won't work in a terrarium. You may think you're doing something wrong, when in actuality it's the plants. Also, I'm not saying that you're guaranteed to have success the first time. If for whatever your first terrarium fails, don't be discouraged! It happens to a lot of people. The whole process is a beautiful learning experience, if you choose to embrace it.

316		80TTZ7HFKWA	Will This Plant Return to Life in 3 Hours?	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"According to the package, this plant will return to life in only three hours! It turns out this claim is completely true. However, the plant was alive the whole time. 

Selaginella lepidophylla (aka the Dinosaur Plant) is a very unique plant. It's a desert plant, native to the Chihuahuan Desert, that is specialized in ""returning to life."" Basically this plant goes into a dehydrated state when exposed to dry conditions, until stimulated by water. With enough moisture the plant will return to its true form in about three hours time... Incredible!

This one focuses mainly on techniques that could help you reduce the overall cost of you project. That said, I feel like using the term “budget vivarium” is somewhat subjective. As I eluded to in the video, I could and do make vivariums MUCH cheaper than this on a regular basis because I buy things in bulk. However, I know the average hobbyist doesn't make as many setups as myself and buying things in bulk is more expensive upfront. Regardless, making a successful vivarium doesn't require a ton of money. 

Jefferey of Reptile Edge supplied me with the Rept-Viv Pro and $75 to set up this vivarium. Reptile Edge is a Canadian based reptile supply company. They sell reptile ledges, enclosures and much more. Check out the below links for more on Reptile Edge.

Like I said in the video, I'm not endorsing this product. I'm simply showcasing it and showing you how I built a decent budget vivarium within it. That said, overall I do think it's a solid enclosure. 

*Here are the list of items that I used to make this vivarium - Cork Bark, Coco Husk, Coco Fiber, Knitting Mesh, Plants (Cryptanthus 'Pink Star', Ficus pumila, Pilea 'Dark Mystery', Fittonia 'White Vein', Syngonium podophyllum 'Regina Red' ), Lumpwood Charcoal, Pea Pebbles (Gravel), Sphagnum Moss, Sand, 100% Silicone and Cork Tiles.

In this video I show you how I set up Delilah's new naturalistic/bioactive vivarium, in a time lapse format. Since I explained everything thoroughly for Henry's, I didn't want the videos to be redundant, so I made a time lapse. What do you think of having a format like this? I could do time lapse builds from time to time, so that I don't keep explaining the same stuff over and over again.

With all of that in mind, I don't actually explain anything about this build in the video. If you are looking to know exactly what I'm doing in this video, then please watch this video: https://youtu.be/aSGq-9kbaxM
 
There will be two more videos in this series, but they won't be published for at least another month. As I said in the previous video, we are going to let these vivariums sit for a little bit and become established, prior to adding the geckos. 

If your wondering what tank this is, it's a DIY plywood enclosure that I made myself. If you want to learn how I made it, check out this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbbhz2XtX34

Here is a list of all of the plants I used in this build: 
Aechmea pineliana miniata, Anubias barteri, Cryptanthus 'Cloud Cover', Cryptanthus nubicola, Ficus pumila, Ficus pumila 'Snowflake', Fittonia 'White Vein', Golden Pothos, Java Moss, Mostera pitterii (Swiss Cheese Vine), Neoregelia 'Fireball', Neoregelia schultsiana 'Cream Fireball', Parlor Palm, Pilea 'Creeping Charlie', Philodendron Silver, Purple Waffle Plant, Selaginella 'Fairy Plume', Sphagnum Moss and Wandering Jew 'Purple'.

In this demonstration, I show you how I made a new and improved setup for my Crested Gecko, Henry. Henry was my first Crested Gecko and the reason why I like these little guys so much. I felt like I owe it to him and Crested Geckos at large, to make another video demonstrating how to set up a suitable vivarium. As I usually say, you do not need to make something this elaborate to keep a happy and healthy animal, but there's no reason not to!  

I'm making three more videos for this series, so if I didn't cover something in this video, chances are that I will in one of the others. I will say though that I have a fan and UVB lighting included in this setup (I know those will be two common questions). I'll expound upon these items in a later video. 

Understand that Crested Geckos are arboreal (spend most, if not all of their time in trees), so when creating a setup, design it in a way that accommodates this aspect of their habitat. Although this tank might not look like it just yet, when it grows in, it will very much mimic a dense canopy. You can't go wrong creating a setup that mimics an animal's natural habit. Good plant choices include large leafed plants and hardy plants that can take a beating. Do a little research and you can easily pick out a good selection. 

Something else I should mention is that this type of background can be done without making three panels. If you want to make a single background panel, follow the same procedure, but make it slightly larger than the width of the inside of your enclosure (roughly 1/8” wider). You could also create it outside of the enclosure like this and silicone it in place. This of course will attach it to the tank, but you could still get the benefits that come with making a background outside of the enclosure.  

If your wondering what tank this is, it's a DIY plywood enclosure that I made myself. If you want to learn how I made it, check out this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbbhz2XtX34

From the bottom of my heart, I humbly and sincerely thank each and every one of you for supporting me along this journey. Making videos and finding success on YouTube have been long term goals of mine, that I never truly pursued until a little over a year ago. With some inspiration, a lot of hard work/dedication and support from all of you, I was able to pursue a dream of mine... and actually got somewhere with it!

In the big scheme, my channel is not that large and SerpaDesign is still very much in its infancy. However this is not about numbers and it's so much bigger than a YouTube channel. This is about embracing a passion and a vision, no matter how impractical it may seem. It's about creating and building up a labor of love that have permeated my entire life.

What I'm getting at is that if you want to do something in your life, just do it and be persistent with it! It doesn't matter where you start, but understand that you have to start somewhere. Had I been more concerted with my efforts on YouTube years ago, it likely wouldn't have took 12 years to get to this milestone. However I don't regret anything about my journey. The journey itself is a work of art.

Where do we go from here? I'm going to continue uploading content like I have been, improve my quality/quantity and build up the platform into more than just YouTube. It's going to take some time, but we'll get there.  

There's so much more that I could say, but I don't feel that it's necessary. The video and my comments above speak for themselves. Again I want to thank you all! Peace and Love!

A lot of you guys ask me where I get my plants. I like to shop around and don't have a single location, but I have ordered from Glass House Works many times. With over 6 shipments of plants, in a span of about 8 years, I have no complaints. Their selection includes some pretty cool/unique plants that seem to be exclusive to them. 

As I said in the video, this is not sponsored or anything of the sort.  I personally have had good results with GHW and would recommend at least checking them out. Here's a link: https://www.glasshouseworks.com/

Disclaimer: As stated, these plants aren't sold exclusively for use in vivariums with animals. So they will need to be cleaned thoroughly and quarantined before use. However, some preventative measures should be taken anyways, regardless of the source. 

The plants that I got in this unboxing include: 
- Acorus gramineus minimus aureus 
- Aechmea pineliana miniata 
- Billbergia T.L.Mead 
- Cryptanthus acaulis 'Jade'
- Cryptanthus 'Black Mystic'
- Cryptanthus 'Cloud Cover'
- Cryptanthus nubicola 
- Cryptanthus 'Snow Goose' 
- Cryptbergia rubra 
- Epipremnum aureum (Golden Pothos)
- Ficus pumila 'Curly'
- Ficus pumila minima 
- Ficus pumila quercifolia (Oak Leaf Creeping Fig)
- Ficus pumila 'Snowflake'
- Ficus pumila variegata 
- Maranta repens (Miniature Prayer Plant)
- Monstera pitterii (Swiss Cheese Vine)
- Neoregelia ampullacea rubra 
- Neoregelia schultsiana 'Fireball' 
- Peperomia campylotropa 
- Selaginella 'Fairy Plume'

As I stated in this video, I highly recommend watching the original build first (if you haven't already), so that you know exactly what I'm doing in this video. To avoid redundancy this build is presented in an abridged format. Follow the link below if you want to see the original build.

Original Plywood Enclosure Build (Large Version): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CJwisimp5o

The enclosures that I built in this video are best suited for tropical environments. If you are looking to make something like this, for an animal that requires more airflow, you could easily modify the design to include more ventilation. 

I realized that I failed to mention the size of these enclosures in the video itself. That said, they measure 24""x24""x30"" so they are each about 75 gallons. However, the light compartment takes up 15 gallons, which leaves 60 gallons of usable space. 

You may wonder why I would go through the trouble to make something like this instead of buying a commercial enclosure. Well in making something like this, I was able to get exactly what I wanted. Plus I don't really care for the viewing panels on most enclosures. My 125g vivarium taught me that I want max visibility and won't take anything less (that tank is ridiculously hard to see in), so I came up with this. 

If you have any questions let me know in the comments and I will do my best to get back to you.

The Co-Owner of this company reached out to me to see if I would be interested in doing an unboxing of this product and here it is. As I said in the video this is not an endorsement or sponsorship, I'm simply giving you my thoughts on this.

If you're interested in learning more about My Aquarium Box, follow the link. http://www.myaquariumbox.com/

The items from this box included Fluval Bug Bites ($7.99), Chemipure Elite ($12.99), ZooMed Betta Leaf ($5.33), 3/4"" Uniseal ($5.99), Mopani Wood ($10.99) and several coupons. This equates to $43.29 worth of aquarium items and $13.29 (the boxes are only $29.99). 

BTW the Chemipure Elite is an all-in-one file media that clarifies the water. Supposedly it will help reduce algae, keep your aquarium healthy/stable and crystal clear. I can't attest to this, but I will give it a try and see if it makes a different. I don't think the camera does it justice, but this aquarium is already pretty clear.

Finally a special thanks to Mike of MASS Aquariums for sending me the My Aquarium Box. I appreciate it! Check out the link to his channel below. He's been keeping fish for over 30 years and seems to know his way around a tank! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAFMaHbiFjKTQRVxj1e8U2g

A special thanks to Justin at H2O Plants for making this scape possible. He supplied me with these great plants. If you want large plants, he will order them for you upon request. The plants in this video are Anubias barteri 'gold coin', Anubias nana 'petite', Anubias nana 'wrinkled leaf', Anubia hastifolia, Anubias hererophylla, Anubias lanceolata, Aponogeton boivinianus and Java Fern.

The current stock of fish includes 5 Green Sunfish, 2 Eastern Dollar Sunfish, 1 Longear Sunfish and 2 Brown Bullhead Catfish. I also have a Pumpkinseed Sunfish and 2 more Eastern Dollar Sunfish that are not yet large enough for this tank. I may get more fish, but at the current time, I'm pleased with this stock of fish. It should be noted that this is not the long-term home for these fish. At some point they will get an upgrade, but this should suffice for a year or two.

Today we take the one year look at the Tiny Native Terrariums and do a little maintenance. They were doing fairly well and are doing even better, now that we went in and freshened them up. 

I have a few other updates that I need to catch up on, such at the “Ship-in-a-Bottle” terrarium. Moving forward I'm going to stick to 6 month and 1 year updates only. After that point I will do an update for every subsequent year. 

As I said in the video if you are having trouble “keeping your terrarium alive” and are using native (temperate) plants, then that's likely why. Temperate plants aren't always a good choice for terrariums and you will likely have to play around a bit to have long term success. I recommend trying out some tropical plants or sticking to native mosses. Most mosses will acclimate quite well to the environment of a closed terrarium.  

Also in regard to springtails, they are not necessarily needed for a terrarium. However, I highly recommend using them. Terrariums tend to mold whenever they are becoming established. Springtails will eat this mold and allow the terrarium to gain equilibrium easier. From this point it is still beneficial to have springtails, but they are not as necessary.

If you haven't seen the original build video for these terrariums, check out this video.

328		zX3wGQpC4eE	Make a Freshwater Aquarium Sump (150g Redo pt.1)	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"Welcome to Part 1 of my 150 Gallon Cube Aquarium redo series. In this session, I reseal the aquarium and deal with filtration. Have you ever wanted to build a sump for freshwater filtration? Well it's quite simple and that's the main focus of this video. As stated, this isn't an all inclusive guide, but it does cover the topic in great detail. Understand also that there are several kinds of sumps (i.e. trickle tower, fluidized, etc.). This is just a simple/traditional sump design. If you are on the fence about building one for yourself it, I highly encourage you to give it a try. 

I have several video coming out for this series and the format will be pretty consistent throughout. I'm taking you on the journey of this aquarium's transformation, by explaining it great detail. Most of the concepts aren't ground breaking, but you should know by now that I'm putting my own creative spin on the whole thing. 

- - Why should you get or make a sump? - -

The great thing about sumps is that they increase the volume of water in your system. The more water in your system, the easier it is to keep a stable environment for your fish friends. Sumps are also extremely versatile and can be customized to meet your specific requirements. All of your hardware, like heaters and thermometers, can easily be hidden in a sump. Finally if your pump breaks, it generally easier and cheaper to replace a pump instead of some obscure part or an entire filter.

- - How much water will drain out from my overflow? - - 

It's extremely important to account for equipment failure or power outage when making a sump. When this occurs, your aquarium will drain down to the overflow and if it's not accounted for in the sump, it will end up on your floor. The easiest way to do this is to measure from the top of your overflow (in my case a street elbow) up to your desired water level, this will be your height. Then measure the length and width of the aquarium. Once you have obtained your measurements, use this link to calculate the volume. http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/converter/volume-calculator.php

For example mine is 36” x 36” x 2” which equals roughly 12 gallons. However, my return nozzle also drains a little bit of the water, so my measurement is actually 36” x 36” x 2.5” which is 14 gallons give or take. This method won't be 100% accurate, but it will give you an educated decision on how to scale your sump. Again, the height of your first baffle will dictate the volume of the sump to a large degree.

- - What pump should I chose for my sump? - -

First things first, spend the extra cash and get a reputable pump! Don't try to save a buck and get some cheap off brand pump. Been there and done that, it's no fun. You will end up wasting money long term and it could end up being detrimental in other ways. 

How do you determine the right size pump (measured by GPH) for your aquarium? It depends on who you ask, but the general consensus seems to be that a pump should turn over 4-6x the volume of your aquarium per hour. My aquarium is 150 gallons and my sump holds about 25 gallons, so in total I am running a 175 gallon system. The SP4 is rated at 1,800 GPH, but based on the head height, it's actually pushing closer to 1,600 GPH. I tend to lean toward more power because of the way that I stock tanks and I don't completely trust the company ratings because of how many variables can be present. Regardless I need a pump that turns over at least 1,050 GPH (175g x 6). If the pump rating is correct I'm actually turning over around 9x the volume per hour. That's a lot more than what's typically recommended, but that's generally how I roll. 

- - Reseal an Aquarium - -

I've been “officially” in the aquarium hobby for over 11 years. Learning how to reseal an aquarium was an early, yet pivotal turning point to my hobby. I started working at 14, but I wasn't making much money. In order to get larger aquariums for cheap I had to learn to repair them. I got most of my larger for pretty cheap It's still going strong to this day. Check out the older video of mine below for an extensive look on how to this. It's amazing to see how much my videos have developed since this upload.

I contacted Justin looking for some large pieces of manzanita wood. Unfortunately he didn't have any, but he sent me pics of the spider wood. I liked it a lot, so I proceed to buy it. From that point he asked me if I needed any plants, so I told him what I was looking for and he sent me these things totally free. 

With that said, I did have the full intent to pay for these items. Anyways a special thanks to Justin for the generosity! Although I got the items in this video for free, it is not a sponsored video and I wasn't payed to say anything. 

If you're in the market for some aquatic plants I would definitely recommend H2O plants. These plants came in extremely healthy and the driftwood is great as well. 

H2O Plant Links:

The plants in this video are Anubias 'Short & Sharp', Aponogeton boivinianus, Blobitis heudelotii, Cryptocoryne wendtii 'red' and Ludwigia SP. 'red'. Also the wood is Spider Wood and Malaysian Driftwood.

I've been keeping exotic animals (amphibians, fish & reptiles) since the age of 6. I'm 25 now, so I've been at it for the better portion of my life. I focus primarily on amphibians and fish, but I also have kept and currently keep some reptiles. A fascination with nature and a desire to bring it indoors, is one of the very few constants of my life. So in short, if you wonder why I keep animals, I do it because it brings me joy.

When you see my collection, realize that it took a long time to amass. I started out keeping American Toads in a 10 gallon aquarium and here we are today. The current line up of animals includes the following 71 critters (if my math is correct):

Amphibians: x1 African Bullfrog, x2 African Clawed Frogs, x1 American Bullfrog and x4 Fire-Bellied Toads

NA Native Fish: x2 Brown Bullhead Catfish, x4 Eastern Dollar Sunfish, x4 Green Sunfish, x1 Longear Sunfish and x2 Pumpkinseed Sunfish

Others: x9 Comet Goldfish, x5 Olive Nerite Snails and x3 Onion Nerite Snails

Reptiles: x1 Blotched Kingsnake and x2 Crested Geckos

Tropical Fish: x1 African Knifefish, x1 Banjo Catfish, x2 Bristolnose Pleco, x1 Common Pleco, x5 Emerald Cory Catfish, x3 Lace Catfish, x4 Pearl Gourami, x8 Silver Dollars, x2 Snakeskin Gourami, x1 Twin Tail Halfmoon Betta and x2 Weather Loaches

Although I have a ton of animals and will surely get more, it's not a numbers game for me. I find joy in keeping animals that I like, while also focusing heavily on naturalistic enclosures and DIY solutions. I strive to create the best possible setups (aesthetically and functionally), while also teaching at the same time. I know that not everyone is loaded and neither am I, so I focus heavily on the DIY aspect of keeping animals. 

If you want to learn how to keep animals in naturalistic enclosures, make cool DIY projects and want quality edutainment (education + entertainment), then you've come to the right place. On this channel I strive to create the most thorough presentations possible and keep the videos entertaining at the same time. With that said, enjoy the latest tour of my animal room!

333		7NUppUD_6CA	Native & Cactus Terrarium 1 Year Updates	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I'm not too upset that these terrariums failed, but I didn't want to let anyone down. That's because what happened was largely, if not all, my fault. Also I know that many of you were looking forward to these updates. So in a way I feel like I failed my subscribers and not myself, especially given the nature of what happened. 

I can assure you that this won't be a common theme here on SerpaDesign and I will also say that all of my other terrariums are doing well. You can expect to see updates on most of those in the near future. I guess this also gives me an excuse to put out more terrarium videos. On a side note, I hear the cries for more terrarium videos! Don't worry I've got a lot of new stuff on the horizon that you're going to love. 

Anyways, the Native Terrarium is somewhat my fault because I could have removed the worms. However I anticipated this, so I just let it be. Plus in some way I enjoy seeing them ""clown around"" in there. I suppose I also wanted an excuse to give it a facelift, so I just let it be. 

The Cactus Terrarium on the other hand is totally my fault. It started out with not getting enough water and then loss of interest on my part, due to various factors. As I said in the video, I am confident in this method for cactus terrariums (I have others that are still doing very well that you haven't seen) it simply came down to user error(s). 

I don't want you to be deterred from making either of these types of terrariums for yourself using my tutorials. I guarantee that the methods I have shown for either terrarium will work. Just take the advice I gave in the video for a more successful build.

This is a simple background to make and it's pretty cheap as well. However you won't be able to get the most realistic looking background with this method. This type of background is also quite versatile. It can be used in a vivarium or aquarium to name a few. Additionally these same principles can be used to make various decorations if applied correctly. You can use your imagination for that or I can show it in the future, but I'm only covering how to make a background in this video. 

This is a tried and true background method. I'm not sure who pioneered the idea, but people have been doing this for a really long time. The way that I create it in this video has worked well for me, but there are many ways to pull off a similar look.

Today we are unboxing some aquatic plants from Justin at H2O Plants. This is not a sponsored video and I wasn't payed to say anything. This is all real talk my friends! 

Anyways the plants in this video are mostly for my Betta's tank. I have been gut loading it with plants as of late and got an awesome set of plants in this unboxing. Go check out my Instagram @SerpaDesign for some updates on his new look before they are posted here on my channel.

If you're in the market for some aquatic plants I would definitely recommend H2O plants. These plants came in extremely healthy and with underwater growth, which is always a plus. They've been in my tank for a week now and there has been some good growth and very little acclimation die off.

The plants in this video are Anubia nana 'petite', Cryptocoryne wendtii 'red', Ludwigia SP 'red', Banana Plant and Queen Moss.

BTW  Queen Moss is from Central America and is a true water moss. The rare moss is fast grows similarly to Java Moss, but has more ""appendage-like"" growth. I wasn't sure during the unboxing, but I can confirm that it's not a type of Java Moss.

DIY Plywood Reptile Enclosure (Large Version)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CJwisimp5o 

When creating this setup I really wanted to keep it functional, while also striving to create a natural aesthetic. That said I used a combination of live plants, common reptile supplies and ingenuity to create something which does exactly that. With all of this in mind there were some serious limitations at hand, most of which are discussed in the video itself. 

I'm sure I will get comments about it, so I will make a brief mention on bioactivity. Typically when we think natural, we think bioactive. In my opinion bioactivity is not the best option for a 6.5 foot long snake. Not to say that it can't be done, but it's just not as advantageous for an animal of this size. So if you're disappointed that I didn't set this up as a bioactive enclosure, I will discuss more about that in the “Behind the Build” for this set of videos.

A final note that I will leave off on is that if you are new to reptiles and want to get a Kingsnake (my personal recommendation) you DO NOT need to make a set up this elaborate. Sure it looks nice and provides all of the necessary requirements for the well being of the snake, but it's simply over the top. I have kept Dean for over 10 years in setups with fake plants, common supplies, etc. and he never acted strange due to the lack of natural elements. If you want to do something like this, by all means do it. Just know that it's really not necessary unless you want something nice to look at other than the snake. 

As stated above, I will upload a final video about this build shortly. There's a lot that I didn't discuss in the DIY build and this setup video that dictated a lot of went down. Anyways enjoy the video!

Well this demonstration shows you how I built a really cool plywood enclosure for my 10 year old Kingsnake Whodini. You could modify this design for smaller enclosures as well (I will show that in a different video). 

This tank could be used for an array of different environments such as tropical, desert or semi-aquatic environments to name a few. Additionally this type of enclosure is suitable for various animals because of how it's made. Also modifications can be easily implemented to create something that fits your animal's specific requirements.

I know this video is long, but I really wanted to show the project in its entirety. I also wanted to show as much of this process as I possibly could. 

As stated in the intro this is a project that was conceived about 3 years ago. I started working on it nearly 3 months ago and it is finally complete. Enjoy!

I failed to mention in the video where I got these fish. That said, I ordered them from jonahsaquarium.com - I would highly recommend this site. The customer service was pretty good and obviously the fish came in nice and healthy. If you looking for some nice native fish, Jonah's Aquarium is an excellent resource to do so.

342		bN_pT2664i0	How to Make a Terrarium Without An Opening	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"I gather containers any time I see them. I don't look for them, I simple get them opportunistically. The Flower Aquarium in this video was no exception. I found it at a thrift store several years ago with the intent to eventually turn it into a terrarium.

I didn't want to just make any or terrarium though, this one had to be special. With that in mind I wanted to make a terrarium that appears as though it doesn't have an opening, a ""No-Opening"" Terrarium if you will.

So after a lot of trouble shooting and experimentation I finally came up with the solution presented in the video. You DO NOT need a Flower Aquarium to do this. A lot of jars and other similar containers could work just as well. 

If you pull this off and I bet you can, you will have people wondering how you did it! I had several people look at my finished terrarium and no one could figure it out.

This layer is the foundation of your terrarium. Strong foundations lead to strong results and weak foundations lead to weak results. 

That said, you typically see me use the Mesh Barrier False Bottom (w/ Window Screen Mesh). From personal experience I have found it to be one of, if not the best method. However, you DO NOT have to use this method. I understand that a lot of you don't have access to the materials that I use or want to try alternatives. 

This video expounds upon the methods that I have found to be the most successful. If you are resourceful you can alter these methods to you specific needs or limitations. As long as the principals and techniques are understood, then you are golden. Not only will your terrarium have a strong foundation, but you will as well! :)

Keep in mind that there are pros and cons to every single method. So whichever False Bottom you choose to make is totally up to you.

This setup came with a lot of obstacles, but that allowed me to demonstrate new techniques that I haven’t shown yet. Of course you get a little update on the other two vivs from the conversion series as well, which are doing great. 

CAUTION: If you ever end up using super glue, make sure that it is completely dry and that all of the fumes have dissipated before adding any inhabitants. If you follow the rule of not adding the inhabitants for awhile, you should be in good shape.

This project has been in the works for a few months and has now come to fruition. 

I will say that it's a somewhat touchy subject on what tank size is appropriate for a Crested Gecko. Although bigger is always better, I strongly believe a 20 gallon setup is sufficient for Crested Geckos. The main requirement is the height. 

Anyways, there is no comparison between this setup and what Henry was previously housed in. Enjoy!

In this episode I will show you how to make a drainable false bottom. This is a crucial element to the long term success and health of your vivarium. 

As implied in the video, there are many other ways that you could do this, but this rendition is by far my favorite for many reason. 

1. It keeps your vivarium light.
2. It allows room for more water than any other method. 
3. In the long term it is cheaper than other methods. 
4. Aesthetically it looks the nicest, IMO.

There's some decent growth thus far, despite the etiolation on the one cactus. That's why I move this terrarium at the end of the video to a brighter location. 

There are a few way to deal with etiolation, but once it occurs, it's pretty much like that for good. Cacti that aren't getting enough light will often times grow faster, giving the illusion of proper conditions. Therefore, it's also a very good idea to put your cacti in a brighter location. 

Etiolation can also occur to cacti that don't receive a dormant period during the winter. So, it's a good idea to make your cacti go dormant between October-March, by lowering or stopping water all together and put it a colder location. 

You can also can also cut off the effected area during the spring if you really don't like how it's shaped."	2m 27s	147	2016-11-20T19:36:44Z			17,007	441			17	Playlist: Uploads from SerpaDesign (added 2016-11-20)		true	true	2d	hd	false	rectangular	youtube	public								14	cactus, cacti, desert, sand, terrarium, nature, naturalistic, horticulture, informtaion, garden, update, growth, DIY, how to	0

This is a highly meticulous terrarium build. It may take a long time to get plants just right and working through the narrow neck of a bottle isn't exactly easy. Use the right tools and be patient when making this terrarium. 

Put your terrarium in a partially lit area, such as a windowsill or window adjacent shelf and enjoy!

In this episode, you will learn EVERYTHING you need to know in order to make an effective and natural-looking Cactus Terrarium. Cacti aren't typically plants that would be housed in a terrarium. Therefore, if there were a cactus terrarium, this is it! 

As mentioned in the video, although you may see cactus terrariums online that look cool, they might not be tailored to the cactus plant (as they should be). In this series we are trying to make effective terrariums that not only look good, but are well-suited to the plants and animals they house. 

*Difficultly Level: Beginner/Intermediate*
Cactus terrariums are pretty easy to care for and maintain as cacti are low maintenance plants for the most part. The difficultly with this terrarium is finding the proper container. Remember to put this terrarium in a bright and warm location.

*Difficultly Level: Beginner*
A closed native terrarium is pretty easy to care for and are cheap to make. They require minimal watering and aren't demanding in other aspects. The difficultly in this terrarium comes with making proper plant selections. Even still, don't get discouraged if yours doesn't work out right the first time, it takes practice and patience. 

A final thing to mention, is that your terrarium will likely mold. This usually happens shortly after your enclosure is first setup. It is very normal and will go away within a few weeks.

Unfortunately the site where I got the tropical moss doesn't sell it anymore. You can use aquatic mosses such as Java Moss or Christmas Moss and tropical moss if you can find.

In this video, he demonstrates how to eat a frozen-thawed mouse with ease. Update: Gunther passed away in February 2015, most likely of old age :'(

Pyxie's are easy to care for and relatively low maintenance.  They make great Amphibians for beginner and experienced herpers alike.  They exhibit great personalities and are generally long lived.  It isn't uncommon for them to live over 20 years in proper (healthy) conditions.  Like any herps, with a little love they will thrive and are sure to bring you joy.

392		0it1foPxtg8	Housing the Beast - DIY 150 Gallon Aquarium Stand, Canopy, & Setup	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"This video features two time lapses, cool designs, and photography by yours truly.  It explains how I constructed a DIY stand suitable for a 150 gallon aquarium.  

This setup was created for my 6 year old Common Snapping Turtle.  In my opinion, Snapping Turtles make great pets due to their intelligence, looks, and overall presence that they add to a room. 

All in all I'm very pleased with the results of this project.  The only issue that really bothers me is that the doors are not entirely square.  Otherwise, everything looks very similar to my vision.  

* Not explained in the video: I made two changes to the canopy which you can see in the final shots.  I added a center brace on the top, so that I can easily carry the canopy and cut off the back-bottom support so that it didn't conflict with the filtration.* 

Update: Olivia passed away in June 2015, of undermined cause. Came home one day and found her dead :'(

393		tAxLSfu4AMo	125 Gallon Terrarium/Vivarium - Anoles, Fire-bellied Toads & House Gecko	UCGzXtNdhjPxvCNWFme1bG0g	SerpaDesign	"This is a video compilation of my 125 gallon terrarium, which has been up and running for about a year and a half now.  I wanted to let it grown in sufficiently, so I waited a little over a year before getting any animals.

The current stock is 5 Brown Anoles and 4 Oriental Fire-bellied Toads.  As you can see in the video I had a Common House Gecko, but unfortunately it managed to find it's way out some time ago.  I want to get some tree frogs and a few other creatures as well, but I haven't decided on what as of now.

I captured some pretty interesting sights in some of these clips.  Communication between animals, mating/courting, eating and death-defying stunts!  

Enjoy!!!

Had to change the original song due to copyright issues.  Sorry for how loud the audio is, can't change the levels on it since it's not the original track.
