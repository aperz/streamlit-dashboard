I added a big chunk of mopani wood from Petsmart as the centerpiece, then added a fern in the rear and several cuts of fittonia of varying size, then added some moss before covering it all with leaf litter. Then I added earthworms, springtails, dubia roaches, and some local isopods and small snails as the cleanup crew and other general life. The isopods ended up eating all the moss though, but otherwise the jar is doing great so far. The one thing I'm missing is millipedes, as we don't have that kind out where I live, and the one time I brought some home with me from a vacation, they ultimately did not survive long enough to reproduce.",

Just a suggestion, but I hope you find it inspiring!",

I really wanted to give back and I could think of no better way than with one of my own creations!\n\nI can only ship this within the contiguous USA though, so I decided to include an additional prize. Anyone within the USA has a chance to win this tank, while my international audience will instead have a chance at $475 USD (value of the enclosure). Just SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, and COMMENT where you're from to be entered. I'll send the comments through a randomizer on the 23rd to select the winners.\n\nOnce again, THANK YOU so much for your support. None of this would be possible without YOU! SerpaSquad 💚💚💚",

Though no surprise as your content is amazing.  After watching several of your terrarium videos, I actually built my first terrarium based on your tips.  It is now home to a miniature orchid (haraella retrocalla) and the start of what I hope will be a brand new hobby (collecting mini orchids and making natural environments for them). I made some mistakes, I'm sure. But as you often say, it was an opportunity to learn for the next build.  Already planning a riparium in the near future! I wouldn't have done it without your inspiration. Looking forward to seeing what you do next! Keep creating and ✌️.",
